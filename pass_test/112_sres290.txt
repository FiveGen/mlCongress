                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                            October 6, 2011

 Mrs. Murray (for herself, Mr. Isakson, and Mr. Begich) submitted the 
        following resolution; which was considered and agreed to

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
 Supporting the designation of October 6, 2011, as ``Jumpstart's Read 
                         for the Record Day''.

Whereas Jumpstart, a national early education organization, is working to ensure 
        that all children in the United States enter school prepared to succeed;
Whereas, year-round, Jumpstart recruits and trains college students and 
        community members to serve preschool children in low-income 
        neighborhoods, helping them to develop the key language and literacy 
        skills necessary to succeed in school and in life;
Whereas, since 1993, Jumpstart has engaged more than 20,000 adults in service to 
        more than 90,000 young children in communities across the United States;
Whereas Jumpstart's Read for the Record, presented in partnership with the 
        Pearson Foundation, is a national campaign that mobilizes adults and 
        children in an effort to close the early education achievement gap in 
        the United States by setting a reading world record;
Whereas the goals of the campaign are to raise awareness in the United States of 
        the importance of early education, provide books to children in low-
        income households through donations and sponsorship, and celebrate the 
        commencement of Jumpstart's program year;
Whereas October 6, 2011, would be an appropriate date to designate as 
        ``Jumpstart's Read for the Record Day'' because it is the date Jumpstart 
        aims to set the world record for the largest shared reading experience; 
        and
Whereas Jumpstart hopes to engage more than 2,100,000 children in reading Anna 
        Dewdney's ``Llama Llama Red Pajama'' during this record-breaking 
        celebration of reading, service, and fun, all in support of preschool 
        children in the United States: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) supports the designation of October 6, 2011, as 
        ``Jumpstart's Read for the Record Day'';
            (2) commends Jumpstart's Read for the Record in its sixth 
        year;
            (3) encourages adults, including grandparents, parents, 
        teachers, and college students--
                    (A) to join children in creating the world's 
                largest shared reading experience; and
                    (B) to show their support for early literacy and 
                Jumpstart's early education programming for young 
                children in low-income communities; and
            (4) respectfully requests the Secretary of the Senate to 
        transmit a copy of this resolution to Jumpstart, one of the 
        leading nonprofit organizations in the United States in the 
        field of early education.
                                 <all>
