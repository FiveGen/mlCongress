                               RESOLUTION


 
  Recognizing the 191st anniversary of the independence of Greece and 
               celebrating Greek and American democracy.

Whereas the ancient Greeks developed the concept of democracy, in which the 
        supreme power to govern was vested in the people;
Whereas the Founding Fathers of the United States, many of whom read Greek 
        political philosophy in the original Greek, drew heavily on the 
        political experience and philosophy of ancient Greece in forming our 
        representative democracy;
Whereas Greek Commander in Chief Petros Mavromichalis, a founder of the modern 
        Greek state, said to the citizens of the United States in 1821 that ``it 
        is in your land that liberty has fixed her abode and. . .in imitating 
        you, we shall imitate our ancestors and be thought worthy of them if we 
        succeed in resembling you'';
Whereas the Greek national anthem, the ``Hymn to Liberty'', includes the words, 
        ``Most heartily was gladdened George Washington's brave land'';
Whereas the people of the United States generously offered humanitarian 
        assistance to the people of Greece during their struggle for 
        independence;
Whereas Greece, in one of the most consequential ``David vs. Goliath'' victories 
        for freedom and democracy in modern times, refused to surrender to the 
        Axis forces and inflicted a fatal wound at a crucial moment in World War 
        II, forcing Hitler to change his timeline and delaying the attack on 
        Russia where the Axis Forces met defeat;
Whereas Winston Churchill said, ``If there had not been the virtue and courage 
        of the Greeks, we do not know which the outcome of World War II would 
        have been.'';
Whereas hundreds of thousands of Greek civilians were killed in Greece during 
        World War II in defense of the values of the Allies;
Whereas, throughout the 20th century, Greece was one of a few countries that 
        allied with the United States in every major international conflict;
Whereas Greece is a strategic partner and ally of the United States in bringing 
        political stability and economic development to the volatile Balkan 
        region, having invested billions in the countries of the region, thereby 
        helping to create many tens of thousands of new jobs, and having 
        contributed more than $750,000,000 in development aid for the region;
Whereas the Government and people of Greece actively participate in peacekeeping 
        and peace-building operations conducted by international organizations, 
        including the United Nations, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, 
        the European Union, and the Organization for Security and Co-operation 
        in Europe, and have more recently provided critical support to the North 
        Atlantic Treaty Organization operation in Libya;
Whereas Greece received worldwide praise for its extraordinary handling during 
        the 2004 Olympic Games of more than 14,000 athletes and more than 
        2,000,000 spectators and journalists, a feat the Government and people 
        of Greece handled efficiently, securely, and with hospitality;
Whereas Greece, located in a region where Christianity meets Islam and Judaism, 
        maintains excellent relations with Muslim nations and Israel;
Whereas the Government of Greece has taken important steps in recent years to 
        further cross-cultural understanding and rapprochement and cooperation 
        in various fields with Turkey, and has also upgraded its relations with 
        other countries in the region, including Israel, thus enhancing the 
        stability of the wider region;
Whereas the Governments and people of Greece and the United States are at the 
        forefront of efforts for freedom, democracy, peace, stability, and human 
        rights;
Whereas those and similar ideals have forged a close bond between the people of 
        Greece and the United States; and
Whereas it is proper and desirable for the United States to celebrate March 25, 
        2012, Greek Independence Day, with the Greek people and to reaffirm the 
        democratic principles from which these two great nations were born: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) extends warm congratulations and best wishes to the 
        people of Greece as they celebrate the 191st anniversary of the 
        independence of Greece;
            (2) expresses support for the principles of democratic 
        governance to which the people of Greece are committed; and
            (3) notes the important role that Greece has played in the 
        wider European region and in the community of nations since 
        gaining its independence 191 years ago.
                                 <all>
