                               RESOLUTION


 
  Designating the week of February 6 through 10, 2012, as ``National 
                       School Counseling Week''.

Whereas the American School Counselor Association has designated the week of 
        February 6 through 10, 2012, as ``National School Counseling Week'';
Whereas the importance of school counseling has been recognized through the 
        inclusion of elementary- and secondary-school counseling programs in 
        amendments to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 
        U.S.C. 6301 et seq.);
Whereas school counselors have long advocated that the education system of the 
        United States must provide equitable opportunities for all students;
Whereas personal and social growth results in increased academic achievement;
Whereas school counselors help develop well-rounded students by guiding the 
        students through academic, personal, social, and career development;
Whereas school counselors assist with and coordinate efforts to foster a 
        positive school culture resulting in a safer learning environment for 
        all students;
Whereas school counselors have been instrumental in helping students, teachers, 
        and parents deal with personal trauma as well as tragedies in the 
        community and the United States;
Whereas students face myriad challenges every day, including peer pressure, 
        depression, the deployment of family members to serve in conflicts 
        overseas, and school violence;
Whereas school counselors are one of the few professionals in a school building 
        who are trained in both education and mental-health matters;
Whereas the roles and responsibilities of school counselors are often 
        misunderstood;
Whereas the school-counselor position is often among the first to be eliminated 
        to meet budgetary constraints;
Whereas the national average ratio of students to school counselors of 459 to 1 
        is almost twice that of the ratio of 250 to 1 recommended by the 
        American School Counselor Association, the American Counseling 
        Association, the National Association for College Admission Counseling, 
        and other organizations; and
Whereas the celebration of National School Counseling Week would increase 
        awareness of the important and necessary role school counselors play in 
        the lives of students in the United States: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates the week of February 6 through 10, 2012, as 
        ``National School Counseling Week''; and
            (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
        the week with appropriate ceremonies and activities that 
        promote awareness of the role school counselors play in the 
        school and the community at large in preparing students for 
        fulfilling lives as contributing members of society.
                                 <all>
