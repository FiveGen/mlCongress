                               RESOLUTION


 
 Supporting the goals and ideals of National Brain Aneurysm Awareness 
                                 Month.

Whereas a brain aneurysm is an abnormal saccular or fusiform bulging of an 
        artery in the brain;
Whereas an estimated 1 out of every 50 people in the United States will develop 
        a brain aneurysm;
Whereas brain aneurysms are most likely to occur in people between the ages of 
        35 and 60;
Whereas brain aneurysms are more likely to occur in women than in men by a 3-to-
        2 ratio;
Whereas brain aneurysms are more likely to occur in African-Americans than in 
        Whites by a 2-to-1 ratio;
Whereas various risk factors can contribute to the formation of a brain 
        aneurysm, including infection, tumors, traumatic head injury, drug use, 
        smoking, hypertension, and a family history of brain aneurysms;
Whereas approximately 6,000,000 people in the United States will develop a brain 
        aneurysm that will not rupture;
Whereas an unruptured brain aneurysm can lead to fatigue, short-term memory 
        problems, speech problems, loss of balance and coordination, and changes 
        in behavior;
Whereas a brain aneurysm is often discovered when it ruptures and causes a 
        subarachnoid hemorrhage;
Whereas a subarachnoid hemorrhage can lead to brain damage, hydrocephalus, 
        stroke, and death;
Whereas annually more than 30,000 people in the United States suffer from 
        ruptured brain aneurysms;
Whereas annually between 3,000 and 4,500 people in the United States with 
        ruptured brain aneurysms die before reaching the hospital;
Whereas a number of advancements have been made in recent years regarding the 
        detection of aneurysms, including the computerized tomography scan, the 
        magnetic resonance imaging test, and the cerebral arteriogram;
Whereas September is an appropriate month to designate as ``National Brain 
        Aneurysm Awareness Month''; and
Whereas various research studies are currently being conducted in the United 
        States in order to better understand, prevent, and treat brain 
        aneurysms: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of National Brain 
        Aneurysm Awareness Month; and
            (2) continues to support research to prevent and treat 
        brain aneurysms.
                                 <all>
