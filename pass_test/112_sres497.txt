                               RESOLUTION


 
 Congratulating the Los Angeles Kings on winning the 2012 Stanley Cup 
                             Championship.

Whereas, on June 11, 2012, the Los Angeles Kings were crowned National Hockey 
        League champions after defeating the New Jersey Devils by a score of 6-1 
        in Game 6 of the 2012 Stanley Cup Finals;
Whereas this is the first Stanley Cup title that the Los Angeles Kings have won 
        since the team entered the National Hockey League in 1967;
Whereas the Los Angeles Kings are the first 8<SUP>th </SUP>seeded playoff team 
        to win the Stanley Cup;
Whereas the Los Angeles Kings never allowed an opposing team with a higher seed 
        or home-ice advantage to intimidate them;
Whereas, en route to their first Stanley Cup appearance since 1993, the Los 
        Angeles Kings quickly dispatched the defending Western Conference 
        Champions, the Vancouver Canucks, dominated the upstart St. Louis Blues, 
        and defeated the Phoenix Coyotes, who were the Pacific Division 
        Champions;
Whereas Los Angeles Kings forward Dustin Brown is the first American team 
        captain of a Stanley Cup champion since 1999;
Whereas Los Angeles Kings goalie Jonathan Quick performed admirably in each 
        playoff game, totaling 125 saves and maintaining a .946 save percentage 
        during the Stanley Cup Finals, and winning the Conn Smythe Trophy, which 
        is awarded to the player considered most valuable to his team during the 
        Stanley Cup Playoffs;
Whereas each of the 26 players on the Los Angeles Kings playoff roster should 
        receive recognition, including Most Valuable Player of the Stanley Cup 
        Playoffs Jonathan Quick, team captain Dustin Brown, Jonathan Bernier, 
        Jeff Carter, Kyle Clifford, Drew Doughty, David Drewiske, Colin Fraser, 
        Simon Gagne, Matt Greene, Dwight King, Anze Kopitar, Trevor Lewis, 
        Andrei Loktionov, Alec Martinez, Willie Mitchell, Jordan Nolan, Scott 
        Parse, Dustin Penner, Mike Richards, Brad Richardson, Rob Scuderi, 
        Jarret Stoll, Slava Voynov, Kevin Westgarth, and Justin Williams; and
Whereas team owners Philip Anschutz and Edward Roski, General Manager Dean 
        Lombardi, and head coach Darryl Sutter admirably assembled the team that 
        comprised the 2012 Los Angeles Kings and led them through one dominant 
        performance after another in the 2012 Stanley Cup Playoffs: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) congratulates the Los Angeles Kings on winning the 2012 
        Stanley Cup Championship; and
            (2) commends the Los Angeles Kings fans in California and 
        across the Nation for showing the team support throughout its 
        45-year history.
                                 <all>
