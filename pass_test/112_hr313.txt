                                 AN ACT


 
  To amend the Controlled Substances Act to clarify that persons who 
enter into a conspiracy within the United States to possess or traffic 
 illegal controlled substances outside the United States, or engage in 
   conduct within the United States to aid or abet drug trafficking 
 outside the United States, may be criminally prosecuted in the United 
                    States, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Drug Trafficking Safe Harbor 
Elimination Act of 2011''.

SEC. 2. AMENDMENTS TO THE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES ACT TO CLARIFY 
              CONSPIRACIES CONDUCTED WITHIN THE UNITED STATES MAY BE 
              CRIMINALLY PROSECUTED IN THE UNITED STATES.

    Section 406 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 846) is 
amended by--
            (1) inserting ``(a)'' before ``Any''; and
            (2) inserting at the end the following:
    ``(b) Whoever, within the United States, conspires with one or more 
persons, or aids or abets one or more persons, regardless of where such 
other persons are located, to engage in conduct at any place outside 
the United States that would constitute a violation of this title, 
other than a violation of section 404(a), if committed within the 
United States, shall be subject to the same


              

penalties that would apply to such conduct if it were to occur within 
the United States.''.

            Passed the House of Representatives December 13, 2011.

            Attest:

                                                 KAREN L. HAAS,

                                                                 Clerk.
