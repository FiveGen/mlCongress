        in the Czech Republic;
Whereas Vaclav Havel was widely recognized and respected throughout the world as 
        a defender of democratic principles and human rights;
Whereas through his extensive writings, Vaclav Havel courageously challenged the 
        ideology and legitimacy of the authoritarian communist regimes that 
        ruled Central and Eastern Europe during the Cold War;

        242 individuals who called for the human rights guaranteed under the 
        1975 Helsinki accords to be realized in Czechoslovakia;
Whereas Vaclav Havel was a cofounder of the Committee for the Defense of the 
        Unjustly Prosecuted, an organization dedicated to supporting dissidents 
        and their families, which helped to advance the cause of freedom and 
        justice in Czechoslovakia;
Whereas Vaclav Havel, as leader of the Civic Forum movement, was a key figure in 
        the 1989 peaceful overthrow of the Czechoslovakian communist government 
        known as the Velvet Revolution;
Whereas following the Velvet Revolution, Vaclav Havel was democratically elected 
        as President of the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic in 1990, and after 
        a peaceful partition forming 2 separate states, democratically elected 
        President of the Czech Republic in 1993;

        international community;
Whereas under the leadership of Vaclav Havel, the Czech Republic became a member 
        of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) on March 12, 1999, and 
        continues to be a valued friend and treasured ally of the United States;
Whereas during his lifetime, Vaclav Havel received praise as one of the world's 
        great democratic leaders and awarded many international prizes 
        recognizing his commitment to peace and democratic principles;
Whereas on July 23, 2003, President George W. Bush honored Vaclav Havel with the 
        Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award of the United 
        States Government, for being ``one of liberty's great heroes'';
Whereas, after leaving office as president of the Czech Republic in February 
        2003, Vaclav Havel remained a voice on behalf of democratic dissidents 
        worldwide and against authoritarian regimes, including Belarus, Iran, 
        Cuba, and Burma:
Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring),

        heartfelt condolences to the Havel family and the people of the

        democratic values in the face of communist repression;
            (3) recognizes Vaclav Havel's pivotal historical legacy in

        War, and building a Europe that is democratic, united, and at 
        peace;
            (4) recognizes Vaclav Havel's solidarity with democratic

        causes of freedom, democracy, and human rights for which Vaclav 
        Havel stood.
