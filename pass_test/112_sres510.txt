                               RESOLUTION


 
   Designating the month of June 2012 as ``National Cytomegalovirus 
                           Awareness Month''.

Whereas congenital Cytomegalovirus (referred to in this preamble as ``CMV'') is 
        the most common congenital infection in the United States, with 1 in 150 
        children born with congenital CMV;
Whereas congenital CMV is the most common cause of birth defects and childhood 
        disabilities in the United States;
Whereas congenital CMV is preventable with behavioral interventions such as 
        practicing frequent hand washing with soap and water after contact with 
        diapers or oral secretions, not kissing young children on the mouth, and 
        not sharing food, towels, or utensils with young children;
Whereas CMV is found in bodily fluids, including urine, saliva, blood, mucus, 
        and tears;
Whereas congenital CMV can be diagnosed if the virus is found in urine, saliva, 
        blood, or other body tissues of an infant during the first week after 
        birth;
Whereas CMV infection is more common than the combined metabolic or endocrine 
        disorders currently in the United States core newborn screening panel;
Whereas most people are not aware of their CMV infection status, with pregnant 
        women being 1 of the highest risk groups;
Whereas the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Centers 
        for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that OB/GYNs counsel women 
        on basic prevention measures to guard against CMV infection;
Whereas, in 1999, the Institute of Medicine stated that development of a CMV 
        vaccine was the highest priority for new vaccines;
Whereas the incidence of children born with congenital CMV can be greatly 
        reduced with public education and awareness; and
Whereas a comprehensive understanding of CMV provides opportunities to improve 
        the health and well-being of our children: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates the month of June 2012 as ``National 
        Cytomegalovirus Awareness Month'' in order to raise awareness 
        of the dangers of Cytomegalovirus (referred to in this 
        resolution as ``CMV'') and reduce the occurrence of congenital 
        CMV infection; and
            (2) recommends that more effort be taken to counsel women 
        of childbearing age of the effect that CMV can have on their 
        children.
                                 <all>
