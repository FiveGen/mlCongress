                                 AN ACT


 
   To provide for a medal of appropriate design to be awarded by the 
President to the memorials established at the 3 sites honoring the men 
  and women who perished as a result of the terrorist attacks on the 
                  United States on September 11, 2001.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Fallen Heroes of 9/11 Act''.

SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) the tragic deaths at the World Trade Center, at the 
        Pentagon, and in rural Pennsylvania on September 11, 2001, have 
        forever changed our Nation;
            (2) the officers, emergency workers, and other employees of 
        State and local government agencies, including the Port 
        Authority of New York and New Jersey, and of the United States 
        government and others, who responded to the attacks on the 
        World Trade Center in New York City and perished as a result of 
        the tragic events of September 11, 2001 (including those who 
        are missing and presumed dead), took heroic and noble action on 
        that day;
            (3) the officers, emergency rescue workers, and employees 
        of local and United States government agencies, who responded 
        to the attack on the Pentagon in Washington, DC, took heroic 
        and noble action to evacuate the premises and prevent further 
        casualties of Pentagon employees;
            (4) the passengers and crew of United Airlines Flight 93, 
        recognizing the imminent danger that the aircraft that they 
        were aboard posed to large numbers of innocent men, women and 
        children, American institutions, and the symbols of American 
        democracy, took heroic and noble action to ensure that the 
        aircraft could not be used as a weapon; and
            (5) given the unprecedented nature of the attacks against 
        the United States of America and the need to properly 
        demonstrate the support of the country for those who lost their 
        lives to terrorism, it is fitting that their sacrifice be 
        recognized with the award of an appropriate medal.
