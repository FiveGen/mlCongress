                               RESOLUTION


 
Celebrating the accomplishments of title IX of the Education Amendments 
  of 1972, also known as the Patsy Takemoto Mink Equal Opportunity in 
 Education Act, and recognizing the need to continue pursuing the goal 
      of equal educational opportunities for all women and girls.

Whereas 40 years ago, on June 23, 1972, title IX of the Education Amendments of 
        1972 (in this preamble referred to as ``title IX'')(20 U.S.C. 1681 et 
        seq.) was signed into law by the President of the United States;
Whereas Representatives Patsy T. Mink and Edith Green led the successful fight 
        in Congress to pass this legislation;
Whereas, on October 29, 2002, title IX was named the ``Patsy Takemoto Mink Equal 
        Opportunity in Education Act'' in recognition of Representative Mink's 
        heroic, visionary, and tireless leadership in developing and passing 
        title IX;
Whereas title IX prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in the 
        administration of any education program receiving Federal financial 
        assistance, including sports, and bars sexual and sex-based harassment, 
        discrimination against pregnant and parenting students, and the use of 
        stereotypes and other barriers to limit a person's access to a 
        particular educational field;
Whereas remarkable gains have been made to ensure equal opportunity for women 
        and girls under the inspiration and mandate of title IX;
Whereas title IX has increased educational opportunities for women and girls, 
        including their access to professional schools and nontraditional fields 
        of study, and has improved their employment opportunities;
Whereas title IX has increased opportunities for women and girls in sports, 
        leading to greater access to competitive sports and building strong 
        values such as teamwork, leadership, discipline, work ethic, self-
        sacrifice, pride in accomplishment, and strength of character;
Whereas, while title IX has been instrumental in fostering 40 years of progress 
        toward equality between men and women in educational institutions and 
        the workplace, there remains progress to be made;
Whereas, in the 2010-2011 school year, girls were provided 1,300,000 fewer 
        opportunities to play high school sports than boys;
Whereas, in 2010, at the typical Division I Football Bowl Subdivision school, 51 
        percent of the students were women, but female athletes received only 28 
        percent of the total money spent on athletics, 31 percent of the money 
        spent to recruit new athletes, and 42 percent of the total athletic 
        scholarship funds;
Whereas research shows that more than 8 out of 10 successful businesswomen 
        played organized sports as children;
Whereas, for girls who engage in sports, 80 percent are less likely to have a 
        drug problem and 92 percent are less likely to have an unwanted 
        pregnancy;
Whereas title IX seeks to protect students from sexual harassment and defend 
        pregnant and parenting students from discrimination;
Whereas stereotypes and discriminatory barriers in the fields of science, 
        technology, engineering, and mathematics persist and contribute to the 
        low numbers of women and girls in those fields;
Whereas, in 2009, women comprised only 19 percent of students receiving 
        baccalaureate degrees in physics, 18 percent of students receiving 
        baccalaureate degrees in computer science, 16 percent of students 
        receiving baccalaureate degrees in engineering and engineering 
        technologies, and 22 percent of students receiving master's or doctorate 
        degrees in engineering and engineering technologies; and
Whereas, while title IX has resulted in significant gains for women and girls in 
        education, the law's full promise of equal educational opportunities for 
        all women and girls has not yet been fulfilled: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) celebrates the accomplishments resulting from the 
        passage of title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, also 
        known as the Patsy Takemoto Mink Equal Opportunity in Education 
        Act, in increasing opportunities for women and girls in many 
        facets of education, including the magnificent accomplishments 
        of women and girls in sports;
            (2) reaffirms the commitment of title IX to ending all 
        discrimination against women and girls in elementary, 
        secondary, and higher education, and to equal opportunities for 
        women and girls in athletics; and
            (3) recognizes the continued importance of title IX in 
        providing needed protections for women and girls.
                                 <all>
