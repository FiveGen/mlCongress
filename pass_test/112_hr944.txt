   To eliminate an unused lighthouse reservation, provide management 
  consistency by incorporating the rocks and small islands along the 
    coast of Orange County, California, into the California Coastal 
 National Monument managed by the Bureau of Land Management, and meet 
 the original Congressional intent of preserving Orange County's rocks

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. PRESERVATION OF ROCKS AND SMALL ISLANDS ALONG THE COAST OF 
              ORANGE COUNTY, CALIFORNIA.

    (a) California Coastal National Monument.--The Act of February 18, 
1931, entitled ``An Act to reserve for public use rocks, pinnacles, 
reefs, and small islands along the seacoast of Orange County, 
California'' is amended by striking ``temporarily reserved'' and all 
that follows through ``United States'' and inserting ``part of the 
California Coastal National Monument and shall be administered as 
such''.
    (b) Repeal of Reservation.--Section 31 of the Act of May 28, 1935, 
entitled ``An Act to authorize the Secretary of Commerce to dispose of 
certain lighthouse reservations, and for other purposes'' is hereby 
repealed.

            Passed the House of Representatives December 7, 2011.

            Attest:
