                               RESOLUTION


 
  Designating September 9, 2012, as ``National Fetal Alcohol Spectrum 
                       Disorders Awareness Day''.

Whereas the term ``fetal alcohol spectrum disorders'' includes a broader range 
        of conditions than the term ``fetal alcohol syndrome'' and has replaced 
        the term ``fetal alcohol syndrome'' as the umbrella term describing the 
        range of effects that can occur in an individual whose mother consumed 
        alcohol during her pregnancy;
Whereas fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are the leading cause of cognitive 
        disability in Western civilization, including the United States, and are 
        100 percent preventable;
Whereas fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are a major cause of numerous social 
        disorders, including learning disabilities, school failure, juvenile 
        delinquency, homelessness, unemployment, mental illness, and crime;
Whereas the incidence rate of fetal alcohol syndrome is estimated at 1 out of 
        every 500 live births and the incidence rate of fetal alcohol spectrum 
        disorders is estimated at 1 out of every 100 live births;
Whereas, in February 1999, a small group of parents with children who suffer 
        from fetal alcohol spectrum disorders united to promote awareness of the 
        devastating consequences of alcohol consumption during pregnancy by 
        establishing International Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Awareness Day;
Whereas September 9, 1999, became the first International Fetal Alcohol Syndrome 
        Awareness Day;
Whereas Bonnie Buxton of Toronto, Canada, the co-founder of the first 
        International Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Awareness Day, asked ``What if ... 
        a world full of FAS/E [Fetal Alcohol Syndrome/Effect] parents all got 
        together on the ninth hour of the ninth day of the ninth month of the 
        year and asked the world to remember that, during the 9 months of 
        pregnancy, a woman should not consume alcohol ... would the rest of the 
        world listen?''; and
Whereas, on the ninth day of the ninth month of each year since 1999, 
        communities around the world have observed International Fetal Alcohol 
        Syndrome Awareness Day: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates September 9, 2012, as ``National Fetal 
        Alcohol Spectrum Disorders Awareness Day''; and
            (2) calls on the people of the United States to observe 
        National Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders Awareness Day with--
                    (A) appropriate ceremonies--
                            (i) to promote awareness of the effects of 
                        prenatal exposure to alcohol;
                            (ii) to increase compassion for individuals 
                        affected by prenatal exposure to alcohol;
                            (iii) to minimize the effects of prenatal 
                        exposure to alcohol; and
                            (iv) to ensure healthier communities across 
                        the United States; and
                    (B) a moment of reflection during the ninth hour of 
                September 9, 2012, to remember that a woman should not 
                consume alcohol during the 9 months of her pregnancy.
                                 <all>
