        government;
Whereas at approximately 10:10 a.m. on January 8, 2011, a gunman attempted the 
        assassination of Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, opening fire at her

Whereas Gabriel Zimmerman began his Congressional career in January 2007 as 
        Constituent Services Supervisor for then newly elected Congresswoman 
        Giffords, a role in which he supervised a robust constituent services

        agencies and to offer other forms of assistance;

        citizens throughout southern Arizona;
Whereas Gabriel Zimmerman organized hundreds of events to allow constituents to 
        meet with Congresswoman Giffords while serving as Director of Community

        Congresswoman Giffords' January 8, 2011 ``Congress on your Corner''

        individuals throughout the Eighth Congressional District;

        Tucson shooting, ``I am horrified by the senseless attack on 
        Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords and members of her staff. An attack on 
        one who serves is an attack on all who serve.''; and
Whereas Gabriel Zimmerman was the first Congressional staffer in history to be 
        murdered in the performance of his official duties: Now, therefore, be 
        it
    Resolved, That room HVC 215 of the Capitol Visitor Center is designated as 
the ``Gabriel Zimmerman Meeting Room''.
