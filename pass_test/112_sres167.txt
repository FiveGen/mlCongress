                               RESOLUTION


 
Recognizing the historical significance of the Mexican holiday of Cinco 
                                de Mayo.

Whereas May 5, or ``Cinco de Mayo'' in Spanish, is celebrated each year as a 
        date of great importance by the Mexican and Mexican-American 
        communities;
Whereas the Cinco de Mayo holiday commemorates May 5, 1862, the date on which 
        the Battle of Puebla was fought by Mexicans who were struggling for 
        their independence and freedom;
Whereas Cinco de Mayo has become one of the most famous Mexican national 
        holidays and is celebrated annually by nearly all Mexicans and Mexican-
        Americans, north and south of the United States-Mexico border;
Whereas the Battle of Puebla was but one of the many battles that the courageous 
        Mexican people won in their long and brave struggle for independence and 
        freedom;
Whereas the French, confident that their battle-seasoned troops were far 
        superior to the almost amateurish Mexican forces, expected little or no 
        opposition from the Mexican army;
Whereas the French army, which had not experienced defeat against any of the 
        finest troops of Europe in more than half a century, sustained a 
        disastrous loss at the hands of an outnumbered, ill-equipped, and 
        ragged, but highly spirited and courageous, Mexican force;
Whereas after three bloody assaults on Puebla in which more than a thousand 
        gallant Frenchmen lost their lives, the French troops were finally 
        defeated and driven back by the outnumbered Mexican troops;
Whereas the courageous and heroic spirit that Mexican General Zaragoza and his 
        men displayed during that historic battle can never be forgotten;
Whereas many brave Mexicans willingly gave their lives for the causes of justice 
        and freedom in the Battle of Puebla on Cinco de Mayo;
Whereas the sacrifice of the Mexican fighters was instrumental in keeping Mexico 
        from falling under European domination;
Whereas Cinco de Mayo serves as a reminder that the foundation of the United 
        States is built by people from many nations and diverse cultures who are 
        willing to fight and die for freedom;
Whereas Cinco de Mayo also serves as a reminder of the close ties between the 
        people of Mexico and the people of the United States;
Whereas in a larger sense, Cinco de Mayo symbolizes the right of a free people 
        to self-determination, just as Benito Juarez once said, ``El respeto al 
        derecho ajeno es la paz'' (``The respect of other people's rights is 
        peace''); and
Whereas many people celebrate during the entire week in which Cinco de Mayo 
        falls: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes the historical struggle for independence and 
        freedom of the people of Mexico; and
            (2) calls upon the people of the United States to observe 
        Cinco de Mayo with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
                                 <all>
