                               RESOLUTION


 
   Recognizing the anniversary of the tragic earthquake in Haiti on 
     January 12, 2010, honoring those who lost their lives in that 
   earthquake, and expressing continued solidarity with the Haitian 
                                people.

Whereas on January 12, 2010, an earthquake measuring 7.0 on the Richter scale 
        struck the country of Haiti;
Whereas, according to the United States Geological Survey, the epicenter of the 
        earthquake was located approximately 15 miles southwest of Port-au-
        Prince, the capital of Haiti;
Whereas, according to the United States Geological Survey, the earthquake was 
        followed by 59 aftershocks of magnitude 4.5 on the Richter scale or 
        greater, with the most severe measuring a magnitude of 6.0 on the 
        Richter scale;
Whereas, according to the Government of Haiti, more than 230,000 people died as 
        a result of the earthquake, including 103 citizens of the United States;
Whereas an untold number of international aid personnel also died as a result of 
        the earthquake, including more than 100 United Nations personnel;
Whereas, according to the United Nations and the International Organization for 
        Migration--

    (1) an estimated 3,000,000 people, or nearly \1/3\ of the population of 
Haiti, have been directly affected by the disaster; and

    (2) an estimated 1,300,000 people were displaced from their homes to 
settlements;

Whereas casualty numbers and infrastructure damage, including damage to roads, 
        ports, hospitals, and residential dwellings, place the earthquake as the 
        worst cataclysm to hit Haiti in more than 200 years and, proportionally, 
        as one of the worst natural disasters in the world in modern times;
Whereas the Post Disaster Needs Assessment, which was conducted by the 
        Government of Haiti, the United Nations, the World Bank, the Inter-
        American Development Bank, and other experts, estimates that damage and 
        economic losses totaled $7,800,000,000, which is equal to approximately 
        120 percent of the gross domestic product of Haiti in 2009;
Whereas the Post Disaster Needs Assessment estimates that $11,500,000,000 is 
        needed during the next 3 years for the reconstruction of Haiti and to 
        lay the groundwork for long-term development;
Whereas Haiti was the poorest, least developed country in the Western Hemisphere 
        before the January 2010 earthquake, when--

    (1) more than 70 percent of Haitians lived on less than $2 per day; and

    (2) Haiti was ranked of 149th out of 182 countries on the United 
Nations Human Development Index;

Whereas, before the earthquake, Haiti was in the process of recovering from a 
        catastrophic series of hurricanes and tropical storms, food shortages, 
        rising commodity prices, and political instability, but was showing 
        encouraging signs of improvement;
Whereas President Barack Obama vowed the ``unwavering support'' of the United 
        States and pledged a ``swift, coordinated and aggressive effort to save 
        lives and support the recovery in Haiti'';
Whereas Senate Resolution 392, which was agreed to on January 21, 2010, by 
        unanimous consent--

    (1) expressed the profound sympathy and unwavering support of the 
Senate for the people of Haiti; and

    (2) urged all nations to commit to assisting the people of Haiti with 
their long-term needs;

Whereas the response to the tragedy from the global community, and especially 
        from the countries of the Western Hemisphere, has been overwhelmingly 
        positive;
Whereas the initial emergency response of the men and women of the United States 
        Government, led by the United States Agency for International 
        Development and United States Southern Command, was swift and resolute;
Whereas individuals, businesses, and philanthropic organizations throughout the 
        United States and the international community responded to the crisis by 
        supporting Haiti and its people through innovative ways, such as 
        fundraising through text messaging;
Whereas more than $2,700,000,000 is estimated to have been raised from private 
        donations in response to the tragedy in Haiti;
Whereas the Haitian diaspora community in the United States, which was integral 
        to emergency relief efforts--

    (1) has annually contributed significant monetary support to Haiti 
through remittances; and

    (2) continues to seek opportunities to partner with the United States 
Agency for International Development and other Federal agencies to rebuild 
Haiti;

Whereas Haiti continues to suffer from extreme poverty, gross inequality, a 
        deficit of political leadership at all levels, and weak or corrupt state 
        institutions;
Whereas significant long-term challenges remain as Haiti works to recover and 
        rebuild;
Whereas the International Organization for Migration estimates that 
        approximately 800,000 people remain in spontaneous and organized camps 
        in Haiti;
Whereas, according to numerous nongovernmental organizations and United States 
        contractors, the pace of reconstruction in Haiti has lagged 
        significantly behind the original emergency relief phase;
Whereas there is an acute need--

    (1) to increase local capacity in health care and education; and

    (2) to focus international attention on employment opportunities, 
rubble removal, permanent and sustainable shelter, reconstruction of roads, 
safety and security, and fundamental human rights in Haiti, especially in 
temporary camps and shelters;

Whereas the alleged irregularities and fraud that occurred in the election held 
        in Haiti on November 28, 2010, have imperiled the credibility of the 
        electoral process, undermined the recovery effort, and further 
        destabilized security throughout Haiti;
Whereas political leadership is required to ensure that a democratically elected 
        government, which is respected by the people of Haiti and recognized by 
        the international community, is prepared to assume office on February 7, 
        2011, or shortly thereafter;
Whereas, on October 19, 2010, an outbreak of cholera was detected in the lower 
        Artibonite region of Haiti;
Whereas initial efforts to contain the epidemic were disrupted by Hurricane 
        Tomas and resulting widespread flooding, which led to the spreading and 
        entrenchment of the disease throughout Haiti;
Whereas, according to the Haitian Ministry of Public Health and Population, 
        between the outbreak in October 2010 and January 21, 2011--

    (1) more than 3,850 people have died from cholera in Haiti; and

    (2) more than 194,000 people in Haiti have been affected by the 
disease;

Whereas, according to the Pan American Health Organization and the Centers for 
        Disease Control and Prevention, cholera could spread to as many as 
        400,000 people within the first year of the epidemic, potentially 
        causing 8,000 deaths at the current case fatality rate;
Whereas the United States has provided $40,000,000 worth of assistance to combat 
        the cholera epidemic, primarily through the Office of Foreign Disaster 
        Assistance, to assist with stockpiling health commodities, equipping 
        cholera treatments centers, providing public information, and developing 
        a safe and sustainable water and sanitation system;
Whereas the efforts to combat the cholera epidemic have helped to drive the 
        mortality rate from cholera down from 7 percent to 1 percent of all 
        contracted cases during the 3-month period ending on January 21, 2011;
Whereas, during the first year following the January 12, 2010 earthquake in 
        Haiti, the people of Haiti have demonstrated unwavering resilience, 
        dignity, and courage;
Whereas at the conference of international donors entitled ``Towards a New 
        Future for Haiti'', which was held on March 31, 2010, 59 donors pledged 
        approximately $5,570,000,000 (including nearly $1,200,000,000 pledged by 
        donors from the United States) to support the Action Plan for National 
        Recovery and Development of the Government of Haiti;
Whereas the United Nations Office of the Special Envoy for Haiti estimates that 
        approximately 63 percent of the recovery and development funds pledged 
        for 2010 have been disbursed; and
Whereas Haiti requires sustained assistance from the United States and the 
        international community in order to confront the ongoing cholera 
        epidemic and promote reconstruction and development: Now, therefore, be 
        it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) honors those who lost their lives as a result of the 
        tragic earthquake in Haiti on January 12, 2010;
            (2) honors the sacrifices of the men and women of the 
        Government of Haiti, the Government of the United States, the

        responses to those affected by the earthquake;

        the spread of cholera, treat persons who contract the disease, 
        provide technical assistance to the Haitian Ministry of Public 
        Health, and improve long-term water, sanitation, and health 
        systems;
            (6) expresses support for the United States Embassy team in 
        Port-au-Prince, members of the United States Coast Guard, 
        United States Armed Forces, other United States Government

        have persevered through adverse local conditions and continue 
        to serve Haiti and the Haitian people;
            (7) supports the continued effort of the Interim Haiti 
        Recovery Commission, under the leadership of former President 
        Bill Clinton and Prime Minister Bellerive, in its efforts to
