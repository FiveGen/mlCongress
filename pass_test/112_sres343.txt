Commemorating the 84th birthday of His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej 
                          on December 5, 2011.

Whereas on June 9, 1946, His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej ascended to the 
        throne and celebrated his 65th year as King of Thailand earlier this 
        year;
Whereas King Bhumibol is the world's longest-serving monarch;
Whereas King Bhumibol has enjoyed a special relationship with the United States, 
        having been born in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1927, while his father 
        was completing his studies in the United States;
Whereas on March 20, 1833, the United States and Thailand (then known as Siam) 
        signed the Treaty of Amity and Commerce, making the Kingdom of Thailand 
        the first treaty ally of the United States in the Asia-Pacific region;
Whereas bilateral trade between Thailand and the United States grew by 38 
        percent between 2002 and 2010;
Whereas the United States and Thailand have remained strong security allies for 
        57 years, as memorialized in the Manila Pact in 1954, and later expanded 
        under the Thanat-Rusk Communique of 1962;
Whereas President Bush designated Thailand as a major Non-NATO Ally on December 
        30, 2003;
Whereas Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, while in Bangkok on November 16, 
        2011, stated ``Our nations are connected through not only security 
        cooperation and business ties, but the democratic values we share and 
        the bonds of family and friendship that link our people.'';
Whereas the Fulbright Program, which was established between Thailand and the 
        United States in 1950, and other exchanges, provide graduate, 
        undergraduate, and high school students from each country the 
        opportunity to study in the other country;
Whereas collaboration between Thailand and the United States has resulted in 
        significant public health achievements;
Whereas in response to the worst flooding in Thailand's history--

    (1) the United States Government--

    G    (A) has provided humanitarian assistance and disaster relief;

    G    (B) is working to help improve Thailand's capacity to prepare and 
respond to such disasters in the future; and

    G    (C) has declared the United States will support Thailand's long-
term recovery; and

    (2) United States citizens and the private sector have donated to 
reconstruction efforts; and

Whereas more than 150,000 people of Thai descent live in the United States.
Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) sends warm wishes to the people of Thailand as they 
        celebrate the 84th birthday of His Majesty King Bhumibol 
        Adulyadej on December 5, 2011, and commemorate his 65-year 
        reign as King of Thailand;
            (2) celebrates the alliance and friendship between Thailand 
        and the United States that reflects common interests, a 178-
        year diplomatic history, and, most importantly, shared values, 
        including democracy, good governance, and the rule of law; and
            (3) expresses its deepest sympathies for the recent 
        historic floods in Thailand, and supports continuing efforts to 
        provide civilian and military assistance to save lives, restore 
        health, and facilitate Thailand's economic recovery.
