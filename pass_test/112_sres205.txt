                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                               RESOLUTION


 
 Designating the period beginning on June 19, 2011, and ending on June 
25, 2011, as ``Polycystic Kidney Disease Awareness Week'', and raising 
awareness and understanding of polycystic kidney disease and the impact 
                     such disease has on patients.

Whereas polycystic kidney disease, known as ``PKD'', is one of the world's most 
        prevalent life-threatening genetic diseases, affecting an estimated 
        600,000 people in the United States, including newborns, children, and 
        adults regardless of sex, age, race, geography, income or ethnicity;
Whereas there are 2 forms of polycystic kidney disease, autosomal dominant 
        (ADPKD), affecting 1 in 500 people worldwide, and autosomal recessive 
        (ARPKD), a rare form, affecting 1 in 20,000 live births and frequently 
        leading to early death;
Whereas polycystic kidney disease causes multiple cysts to form on both kidneys 
        (ranging in size from a pinhead to a grapefruit), leading to an increase 
        in kidney size and weight;
Whereas polycystic kidney disease is a systemic disease that causes damage to 
        the kidneys and the cardiovascular, endocrine, hepatic, and 
        gastrointestinal systems;
Whereas patients with polycystic kidney disease often experience no symptoms 
        early in the disease, and many patients do not realize they have 
        polycystic kidney disease until other organs are affected;
Whereas symptoms of polycystic kidney disease may include high blood pressure, 
        chronic pain in the back, sides or abdomen, blood in the urine, urinary 
        tract infection, heart disease, and kidney stones;
Whereas polycystic kidney disease is the number one genetic cause of kidney 
        failure in the United States;
Whereas more than half of polycystic kidney disease patients will reach kidney 
        failure and require dialysis or a kidney transplant to survive, thus 
        placing an extra strain on dialysis and kidney transplantation 
        resources;
Whereas there is no treatment or cure for polycystic kidney disease; and
Whereas there are thousands of volunteers nationwide dedicated to expanding 
        essential research, fostering public awareness and understanding, 
        educating patients and their families about polycystic kidney disease to 
        improve treatment and care, providing appropriate moral support, and 
        encouraging people to become organ donors: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates the period beginning on June 19, 2011, and 
        ending on June 25, 2011, as ``Polycystic Kidney Disease 
        Awareness Week'';
            (2) supports the goals and ideals of Polycystic Kidney 
        Disease Awareness Week, to raise public awareness and 
        understanding of polycystic kidney disease;
            (3) recognizes the need for additional research to find 
        treatments and a cure for polycystic kidney disease; and
            (4) encourages the people of the United States and 
        interested groups to support Polycystic Kidney Disease 
        Awareness Week through appropriate ceremonies and activities, 
        to promote public awareness of polycystic kidney disease, and 
        to foster understanding of the impact of such disease on 
        patients and their families.
