Recognizing the efforts and accomplishments of the GOD'S CHILD Project 
  and congratulating the GOD'S CHILD Project on its 20th anniversary.

Whereas international educator, human rights leader, and native of the State of 
        North Dakota Patrick Atkinson, deeply concerned about the plight of poor 
        and exploited children around the globe, established the nonprofit GOD'S 
        CHILD Project in 1991 with the mission of breaking the bitter chains of 
        poverty through education and information;
Whereas the GOD'S CHILD Project has a global presence, serving the most 
        vulnerable women and children on 3 continents, with operations in El 
        Salvador, Guatemala, India, Malawi, and the United States;
Whereas the international GOD'S CHILD Project, true to its roots, maintains its 
        global headquarters in Bismarck, North Dakota;
Whereas more than 5,000 orphaned, abandoned, and impoverished children and 
        nearly 8,700 widowed, abandoned, and single mothers and their dependents 
        receive care from, and are educated by, the GOD'S CHILD Project;
Whereas since the GOD'S CHILD Project was founded, more than 18,000 parentless 
        children and thousands more women have been given hope by the GOD'S 
        CHILD Project;
Whereas the GOD'S CHILD Project, taking a comprehensive view of helping the 
        destitute and exploited break free from poverty and oppression, operates 
        schools, a family clinic, social work department, psychology clinic, 
        domestic violence program, legal aid department, and a center for 
        malnourished children;
Whereas in response to the transnational problem of human trafficking, the GOD'S 
        CHILD Project established the Institute for Trafficked, Exploited, and 
        Missing Persons in 2001 to address the issues of human trafficking and 
        exploitation, which are particularly severe in Central America;
Whereas the GOD'S CHILD Project is often 1 of the first organizations to respond 
        to devastating natural disasters, including Tropical Storm Agatha, which 
        ravaged Central America in 2010, taking nearly 180 lives and destroying 
        the homes of thousands;
Whereas each year, approximately 2,500 volunteers and 45 homebuilding groups 
        from around the world join with the GOD'S CHILD Project staff to 
        compassionately serve their brothers and sisters in need; and
Whereas the GOD'S CHILD Project has received numerous accolades recognizing its 
        service to the poor from United States and foreign organizations, 
        including the Guatemalan Congressional Medal of Honor, Guatemala's 
        Goodwill Ambassador For Peace, and the 2010 Humanitarian Award from the 
        Bismarck City Human Rights Commission: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) congratulates the GOD'S CHILD Project on its 20th 
        anniversary;
            (2) commends the GOD'S CHILD Project for its charitable 
        service to the poor and its efforts to help thousands break the 
        bonds of poverty and exploitation; and
            (3) recognizes those individuals who have served 
        impoverished children and women throughout the world under the 
        auspices of the GOD'S CHILD Project, including the volunteers 
        and staff of the GOD'S CHILD Project.
                                 <all>
