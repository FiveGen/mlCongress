                               RESOLUTION


 
         Designating November 2011 as ``COPD Awareness Month''.

Whereas chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (referred to in this preamble as 
        ``COPD''), also known as chronic bronchitis and emphysema, is the third 
        leading cause of death in the United States and is the only 1 of the top 
        5 causes of death with a rising prevalence and death rate;
Whereas COPD is a chronic and progressive disease that affects over 24,000,000 
        people in the United States, \1/2\ of whom have not been properly 
        diagnosed;
Whereas COPD claims the lives of more than 120,000 people of the United States 
        each year, with a person dying every 4 minutes from COPD;
Whereas COPD is considered to be the second leading cause of disability in the 
        United States;
Whereas in 2011 COPD cost the United States approximately $49,900,000,000 per 
        year;
Whereas the major risk factor for COPD is smoking and other risk factors include 
        exposure to air pollution, industrial irritants, and burned biomass 
        fuels;
Whereas COPD can also result from genetic conditions, such as alpha-1 
        antitrypsin deficiency;
Whereas many patients suffering with COPD are not diagnosed until they have 
        reached an advanced stage of COPD;
Whereas a diagnostic test for COPD, known as spirometry, is available for office 
        use, allowing early diagnosis of COPD;
Whereas the National Institutes of Health, Centers for Disease Control and 
        Prevention, and the Department of Veterans Affairs play a critical role 
        in advancing the prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and ultimately a cure 
        for COPD;
Whereas primary care physicians are in a key position to provide optimal care to 
        patients with COPD and need to be trained to diagnose and treat the 
        disease;
Whereas individuals with COPD who are able to receive education from allied 
        health professionals, such as respiratory therapists, have better health 
        outcomes;
Whereas appropriately treating COPD with medication and health management can 
        reduce hospital readmissions and costly exacerbations; and
Whereas increased public awareness, screening, early detection, and treatment of 
        COPD are crucial in the prevention or slowing the progression of lung 
        disease and can lead to reduced costs and better quality of life: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates November 2011 as ``COPD Awareness Month'';
            (2) encourages all people of the United States to become 
        more informed about chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
        (referred to in this resolution as ``COPD'') and get screened 
        if they are at risk; and
            (3) encourages further partnership between the Federal 
        government and private entities to enhance patient education 
        about COPD.
                                 <all>
