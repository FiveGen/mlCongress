  Congratulating Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, on its 100th anniversary.

Whereas February 5, 2011, marks the 100th anniversary of the establishment of 
        Brooklyn Center, Minnesota;
Whereas in the summer of 1852, individuals came to Brooklyn Center and cleared 
        rich, tillable land to farm and build homes;
Whereas those industrious individuals quickly transformed Brooklyn Center into a 
        prosperous farming community, where Minnesotans grew and gathered 
        harvests that fed countless families throughout the region;
Whereas Brooklyn Center was incorporated as a village in 1911, became a city in 
        1967, and continues to be a community where all residents can feel proud 
        to live, work, and raise their families;
Whereas Brooklyn Center has successfully balanced economic growth and business 
        development with an enduring focus on family values and small town 
        charm;
Whereas, as of the date of agreement to this resolution, Brooklyn Center boasts 
        522 acres of parks and nature centers, a first-rate education system, 
        quality health care options, accessible transportation, and the historic 
        Earle Brown Heritage Center; and
Whereas Brooklyn Center is a city with a proud history and a strong place in the 
        heritage of the State of Minnesota and the United States: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) congratulates Brooklyn Center, Minnesota on its 100th 
        anniversary; and
            (2) commends the Minnesotans who have made Brooklyn Center, 
        Minnesota ``A Great Place to Start and a Great Place to Stay''.
