                               RESOLUTION


 
 Recognizing the 75th anniversary of the founding of Ducks Unlimited, 
     Incorporated, the achievements of the organization in habitat 
conservation, and the support of the organization for the waterfowling 
                     heritage of the United States.

Whereas Ducks Unlimited, Incorporated (referred to in this preamble as ``Ducks 
        Unlimited'') was founded in 1937, when the drought-plagued waterfowl 
        populations of North America plunged to unprecedented lows;
Whereas, after decades of commitment to conserving waterfowl habitats, Ducks 
        Unlimited has become the largest private organization for waterfowl and 
        wetlands conservation worldwide and one of the most effective private 
        organizations dedicated to that cause;
Whereas, since the founding of Ducks Unlimited, the organization has conserved 
        and protected more than 4,500,000 acres of waterfowl habitat in the 
        United States and more than 12,600,000 acres of waterfowl habitat in 
        North America;
Whereas Ducks Unlimited has nearly 750,000 members internationally, including 
        550,000 members in the United States;
Whereas, since the founding of Ducks Unlimited, the organization has raised more 
        than $3,400,000,000 for waterfowl conservation and education, leveraging 
        public support to obtain more than half of its contributions from 
        private sources;
Whereas Ducks Unlimited provides support to local projects that are important to 
        waterfowlers in each State of the United States; and
Whereas Ducks Unlimited maintains the vital mission of conserving, restoring, 
        and managing wetlands and associated habitats for the waterfowl of North 
        America, a mission that also benefits other wildlife and people: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate recognizes the important contributions of 
Ducks Unlimited, Incorporated and its members across the United States 
to the conservation of habitats and the preservation of the waterfowl 
of North America during the past 75 years.
                                 <all>
