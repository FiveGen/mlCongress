H. Res. 775

                In the House of Representatives, U. S.,

                                                    September 13, 2012.
Whereas on Sunday, August 5, 2012, a shooting took place at the Sikh Temple of 
        Wisconsin in Oak Creek, Wisconsin;
Whereas as a result of the shooting, six innocent individuals lost their lives 
        while preparing to attend a Sunday morning worship;
Whereas three individuals were severely injured in the attack;
Whereas many individuals and members of the Sikh community selflessly sought to 
        aid and protect others above their own safety; and
Whereas the quick action of law enforcement officials prevented additional 
        losses of life: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) condemns the senseless attack at the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin in 
        Oak Creek, Wisconsin, on Sunday, August 5, 2012;
            (2) offers condolences to the families, friends, and loved ones who 
        were killed in the attack and expresses hope for the full recovery of 
        those injured in the attack;
            (3) honors the selfless, dedicated service of--
                    (A) the emergency response teams and law enforcement 
                officials who responded to the attack; and
                    (B) law enforcement officials who continue to investigate 
                the attack; and
            (4) remains hopeful, as additional details regarding the attack are 
        gathered, that the citizens of this country will come together, united 
        in a shared desire for peace and justice while standing with the Sikh 
        community to grieve the loss of life.
            Attest:

                                                                          Clerk.
