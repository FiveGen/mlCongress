                               RESOLUTION


 
 Recognizing ``National Foster Care Month'' as an opportunity to raise 
 awareness about the challenges of children in the foster care system, 
 and encouraging Congress to implement policy to improve the lives of 
                  children in the foster care system.

Whereas ``National Foster Care Month'' was established more than 20 years ago to 
        bring foster care issues to the forefront, to highlight the importance 
        of permanency for every child, and to recognize the essential role that 
        foster parents, social workers, and advocates have in the lives of 
        children in foster care throughout the United States;
Whereas all children deserve a safe, loving, and permanent home;
Whereas the primary goal of the foster care system is to ensure the safety and 
        well-being of children while working to provide a safe, loving, and 
        permanent home for each child;
Whereas there are approximately 420,000 children living in foster care;
Whereas there are 115,000 children in foster care awaiting adoption;
Whereas 57,000 children are adopted out of foster care each year;
Whereas children of color are more likely to stay in the foster care system for 
        longer periods of time and are less likely to be reunited with their 
        biological families;
Whereas the number of available foster homes is declining, and there are only 
        2.8 foster homes for every 10 children in foster care;
Whereas children entering foster care often confront the widespread 
        misperception that children in foster care are disruptive, unruly, and 
        dangerous, even though placement in foster care is based on the actions 
        of a parent or guardian, not the child;
Whereas foster care is intended to be a temporary placement, but children remain 
        in the foster care system for an average of 2 years;
Whereas children in foster care experience an average of 3 different placements, 
        which often leads to disruption of routines, and the need to change 
        schools and move away from siblings, extended families, and familiar 
        surroundings;
Whereas more than 29,000 youth ``age out'' of foster care without a legal 
        permanent connection to an adult or family;
Whereas the number of youth who ``age out'' of foster care has steadily 
        increased for the past decade;
Whereas children who ``age out'' of foster care lack the security or support of 
        a biological or adoptive family and frequently struggle to secure 
        affordable housing, obtain health insurance, pursue higher education, 
        and acquire adequate employment;
Whereas on average, 8.5 percent of the positions in child protective services 
        remain vacant;
Whereas due to heavy caseloads and limited resources, the average tenure for a 
        worker in child protection services is just 3 years;
Whereas States, localities, and communities should be encouraged to invest 
        resources in preventative and reunification services and post-permanency 
        programs to ensure that more children in foster care are provided with 
        safe, loving, and permanent placements;
Whereas the Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 
        2008 (Public Law 110-351; 122 Stat. 3949) provides for new investments 
        and services to improve the outcomes of children and families in the 
        foster care system; and
Whereas much remains to be done to ensure that all children have a safe, loving, 
        nurturing, and permanent family, regardless of age or special needs: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes ``National Foster Care Month'' as an 
        opportunity to raise awareness about the challenges that 
        children in the foster care system face;
            (2) encourages Congress to implement policy to improve the 
        lives of children in the foster care system;
            (3) supports the designation of May as ``National Foster 
        Care Month'';
            (4) acknowledges the special needs of children in the 
        foster care system;
            (5) honors the commitment and dedication of the individuals 
        who work tirelessly to provide assistance and services to 
        children in the foster care system; and
            (6) reaffirms the need to continue working to improve the 
        outcomes of all children in the foster care system through 
        title IV of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) and 
        other programs designed to help children in the foster care 
        system reunite with their biological parents or, if the 
        children cannot be reunited with their biological parents, find 
        permanent, safe, and loving homes.
                                 <all>
