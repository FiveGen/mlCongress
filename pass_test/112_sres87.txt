Whereas the cooperative business model has empowered people around the world to 
        improve their lives through economic and social progress;
Whereas cooperatives are a major economic force in developed countries and a 
        powerful business model in developing countries, employing approximately 
        100,000,000 people;
Whereas there are millions of cooperatives, which are owned and governed by more 
        than 1,000,000,000 members, operating in every nation of the world;

        December 18, 2009, designates the year 2012 as the ``International Year 
        of Cooperatives'';
Whereas the theme of the International Year of Cooperatives is ``Cooperative 
        Enterprise Builds a Better World''; and
Whereas cooperatives are the businesses of the people, and for more than a

            (3) recognizes the vital role cooperatives play in the 
        economic and social well-being of the United States;
            (4) urges the establishment of a National Committee for the

        representatives from each Federal agency, all cooperative 
        sectors, and key stakeholders;
            (5) recognizes the importance of raising the profile of 
        cooperatives and demonstrating the manner by which cooperatives 
        build local wealth, generate employment, and provide 
        competition in the marketplace; and
            (6) encourages highlighting the positive impact of 
        cooperatives and developing new programs for domestic and 
        international cooperative development.
