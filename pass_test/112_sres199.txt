  Supporting the goals and ideals of ``Crohn's and Colitis Awareness 
                                Week''.

Whereas Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are serious, chronic inflammatory 
        diseases of the gastrointestinal tract;
Whereas Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, collectively known as 
        inflammatory bowel disease, afflict approximately 1,400,000 people in 
        the United States, 30 percent of whom are diagnosed as children;
Whereas the cause of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are unknown and no 
        medical cure exists;
Whereas Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis can affect anyone, at any age, 
        and is being diagnosed with increased frequency in children;
Whereas Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis patients are at high risk for 
        developing colorectal cancer;
Whereas a lack of awareness among health professionals and the general public 
        may contribute to the misdiagnosis and mismanagement of Crohn's disease 
        and ulcerative colitis;
Whereas the annual direct cost of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis in the 
        United States is estimated to be $6,100,000,000;
Whereas the goals of ``Crohn's and Colitis Awareness Week'' are--

    (1) to invite and encourage all people in the United States to join the 
effort to find a cure for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis;

    (2) to engage in activities aimed at raising awareness of Crohn's 
disease and ulcerative colitis among the general public and health care 
providers; and

    (3) to promote and support biomedical research needed to find better 
treatments and a cure for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis; and

Whereas the week of December 1, 2011, through December 7, 2011, has been 
        designated ``Crohn's and Colitis Awareness Week'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of ``Crohn's and Colitis 
        Awareness Week'';
            (2) encourages media organizations to participate in 
        ``Crohn's and Colitis Awareness Week'' by helping to educate 
        the general public about Crohn's disease and ulcerative 
        colitis;
            (3) recognizes all people in the United States living with 
        Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis and expresses 
        appreciation to the family members and caregivers who support 
        them; and
            (4) commends the dedication of health care professionals 
        and biomedical researchers who care for Crohn's disease and 
        ulcerative colitis patients and work to advance basic, genetic, 
        and clinical research aimed at developing new treatments and a 
        cure for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.
