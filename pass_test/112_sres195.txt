                              May 23, 2011

 Mr. Brown of Massachusetts (for himself and Mr. Kerry) submitted the 
        following resolution; which was considered and agreed to

                               RESOLUTION


 
      Commemorating the 150th anniversary of the founding of the 
   Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Whereas when the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (referred to in this 
        preamble as ``MIT'') was founded by William Barton Rogers, on April 10, 
        1861, the doors to a powerful new institution for education, discovery, 
        and technological advancement were opened;
Whereas the commitment of MIT to innovation and the entrepreneurial spirit has 
        trained innovators and delivered groundbreaking technologies that have 
        significantly contributed to the fields of computing, molecular biology, 
        sustainable development, biomedicine, new media, energy, and the 
        environment;
Whereas there are an estimated 6,900 companies founded by MIT alumni in the 
        State of Massachusetts alone, which have earned worldwide sales of 
        approximately $164,000,000,000 and represent 26 percent of total sales 
        made by Massachusetts companies;
Whereas the distinguished living alumni of MIT have founded approximately 25,800 
        companies that, as of 2011, provide jobs for approximately 3,300,000 
        people around the world and earn $2,200,000,000,000 in annual sales;
Whereas MIT has many notable alumni and professors who have contributed to 
        leading research and development efforts, including 76 Nobel Prize 
        recipients and astronauts who have flown more than \1/3\ of the manned 
        spaceflights of the United States;
Whereas MIT engineers and researchers have pioneered countless innovations, 
        including the creation of random-access magnetic-core memory (commonly 
        known as ``RAM''), which led to the digital revolution, the mapping of 
        the human genome, the creation of GPS navigation technology, and the 
        engineering of the computers that landed Americans on the moon;
Whereas MIT biomedical researchers remain at the forefront of many fields and 
        have contributed years of key advancements, such as the first chemical 
        synthesis of penicillin, the invention of heart stents, and the mapping 
        of molecular defects to produce the first targeted therapies for cancer 
        treatment; and
Whereas MIT has excelled as a world-renowned pioneer that promotes science and 
        engineering education, economic growth, scientific breakthroughs, and 
        technological advancement in the State of Massachusetts and throughout 
        the world: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) commemorates the 150th anniversary of the founding of 
        the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, 
        Massachusetts; and
            (2) honors the outstanding contributions made by the 
        alumni, professors, and staff of the Massachusetts Institute of 
        Technology throughout the past 150 years, including the efforts 
        supported by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that 
        have spurred the industrial progress of the United States 
        through innovation.
