                               RESOLUTION


 
    Supporting ``Lights On Afterschool'', a national celebration of 
                         afterschool programs.

Whereas high-quality afterschool programs provide safe, challenging, engaging, 
        and fun learning experiences that help children and youth develop 
        social, emotional, physical, cultural, and academic skills;
Whereas high-quality afterschool programs support working families by ensuring 
        that the children in those families are safe and productive after the 
        regular school day ends;
Whereas high-quality afterschool programs build stronger communities by 
        involving students, parents, business leaders, and adult volunteers in 
        the lives of children in the United States, thereby promoting positive 
        relationships among children, youth, families, and adults;
Whereas high-quality afterschool programs engage families, schools, and diverse 
        community partners in advancing the well-being of children in the United 
        States;
Whereas ``Lights On Afterschool'', a national celebration of afterschool 
        programs held on October 20, 2011, highlights the critical importance of 
        high-quality afterschool programs in the lives of children, their 
        families, and their communities;
Whereas more than 28,000,000 children in the United States have parents who work 
        outside the home and approximately 15,100,000 children in the United 
        States have no place to go after school; and
Whereas many afterschool programs across the United States are struggling to 
        keep their doors open and their lights on: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate supports the goals and ideals of ``Lights 
On Afterschool'', a national celebration of afterschool programs.
                                 <all>
