                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing support for designation of a ``Welcome Home Vietnam Veterans 
                                 Day''.

Whereas the Vietnam War was fought in the Republic of South Vietnam from 1961 to 
        1975, and involved North Vietnamese regular forces and Viet Cong 
        guerrilla forces in armed conflict with United States Armed Forces and 
        the Army of the Republic of Vietnam;
Whereas the United States Armed Forces became involved in Vietnam because the 
        United States Government wanted to provide direct military support to 
        the Government of South Vietnam to defend itself against the growing 
        Communist threat from North Vietnam;
Whereas members of the United States Armed Forces began serving in an advisory 
        role to the Government of the Republic of South Vietnam in 1961;
Whereas, as a result of the Gulf of Tonkin incidents on August 2 and 4, 1964, 
        Congress overwhelmingly passed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution (Public Law 
        88-408), on August 7, 1964, which provided the authority to the 
        President of the United States to prosecute the war against North 
        Vietnam;
Whereas, in 1965, United States Armed Forces ground combat units arrived in 
        Vietnam;
Whereas, by the end of 1965, there were 80,000 United States troops in Vietnam, 
        and by 1969, a peak of approximately 543,000 troops was reached;
Whereas, on January 27, 1973, the Treaty of Paris was signed, which required the 
        release of all United States prisoners-of-war held in North Vietnam and 
        the withdrawal of all United States Armed Forces from South Vietnam;
Whereas, on March 30, 1973, the United States Armed Forces completed the 
        withdrawal of combat units and combat support units from South Vietnam;
Whereas, on April 30, 1975, North Vietnamese regular forces captured Saigon, the 
        capitol of South Vietnam, effectively placing South Vietnam under 
        Communist control;
Whereas more than 58,000 members of the United States Armed Forces lost their 
        lives in Vietnam and more than 300,000 members of the Armed Forces were 
        wounded;
Whereas, in 1982, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial was dedicated in the District of 
        Columbia to commemorate those members of the United States Armed Forces 
        who died or were declared missing-in-action in Vietnam;
Whereas the Vietnam War was an extremely divisive issue among the people of the 
        United States and a conflict that caused a generation of veterans to 
        wait too long for the United States public to acknowledge and honor the 
        efforts and services of such veterans;
Whereas members of the United States Armed Forces who served bravely and 
        faithfully for the United States during the Vietnam War were often 
        wrongly criticized for the policy decisions made by 4 presidential 
        administrations in the United States;
Whereas the establishment of a ``Welcome Home Vietnam Veterans Day'' would be an 
        appropriate way to honor those members of the United States Armed Forces 
        who served in South Vietnam and throughout Southeast Asia during the 
        Vietnam War; and
Whereas March 30, 2011, would be an appropriate day to establish as ``Welcome 
        Home Vietnam Veterans Day'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) honors and recognizes the contributions of veterans who 
        served in the United States Armed Forces in Vietnam during war 
        and during peace;
            (2) encourages States and local governments to also 
        establish ``Welcome Home Vietnam Veterans Day''; and
            (3) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
        ``Welcome Home Vietnam Veterans Day'' with appropriate 
        ceremonies and activities that--
                    (A) provide the appreciation Vietnam War veterans 
                deserve, but did not receive upon returning home from 
                the war;
                    (B) demonstrate the resolve that never again shall 
                the Nation disregard and denigrate a generation of 
                veterans;
                    (C) promote awareness of the faithful service and 
                contributions of such veterans during their military 
                service as well as to their communities since returning 
                home;
                    (D) promote awareness of the importance of entire 
                communities empowering veterans and the families of 
                veterans to readjust to civilian life after military 
                service; and
                    (E) promote opportunities for such veterans to 
                assist younger veterans returning from the wars in Iraq 
                and Afghanistan in rehabilitation from wounds, both 
                seen and unseen, and to support the reintegration of 
                younger veterans into civilian life.
                                 <all>
