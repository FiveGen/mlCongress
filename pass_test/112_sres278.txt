                               RESOLUTION


 
  Designating September 2011 as ``National Prostate Cancer Awareness 
                                Month''.

Whereas countless families in the United States live with prostate cancer;
Whereas 1 in 6 males in the United States will be diagnosed with prostate cancer 
        in his lifetime;
Whereas prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed non-skin cancer and the 
        second most common cause of cancer-related deaths among males in the 
        United States;
Whereas in 2011, the American Cancer Society estimates that 240,890 males in the 
        United States will be diagnosed with prostate cancer, and 33,720 males 
        will die from the disease;
Whereas 30 percent of newly diagnosed prostate cancer cases occur in males under 
        the age of 65;
Whereas approximately every 14 seconds, a male in the United States turns 50 
        years old and increases his odds of developing cancer, including 
        prostate cancer;
Whereas African-American males suffer from a prostate cancer incidence rate that 
        is up to 65 percent higher than White males and have double the prostate 
        cancer mortality rate of White males;
Whereas obesity is a significant predictor of the severity of prostate cancer;
Whereas the probability that obesity will lead to death and high cholesterol 
        levels is strongly associated with advanced prostate cancer;
Whereas males in the United States with 1 family member diagnosed with prostate 
        cancer have a 1 in 3 chance of being diagnosed with the disease, males 
        with 2 family members diagnosed have an 83 percent chance, and males 
        with 3 family members diagnosed have a 97 percent chance;
Whereas screening by a digital rectal examination and a prostate-specific 
        antigen blood test can detect the disease at the early stages, 
        increasing the chances of survival for more than 5 years to nearly 100 
        percent;
Whereas only 33 percent of males survive more than 5 years if diagnosed during 
        the late stages of the disease;
Whereas there are no noticeable symptoms of prostate cancer while it is still in 
        the early stages, making screening critical;
Whereas ongoing research promises further improvements in prostate cancer 
        prevention, early detection, and treatment; and
Whereas educating people in the United States, including health care providers, 
        about prostate cancer and early detection strategies is crucial to 
        saving the lives of males and preserving and protecting families: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates September 2011 as ``National Prostate Cancer 
        Awareness Month'';
            (2) declares that steps should be taken--
                    (A) to raise awareness about the importance of 
                screening methods for, and treatment of, prostate 
                cancer;
                    (B) to increase research funding that is 
                commensurate with the burden of prostate cancer so 
                that--
                            (i) screening and treatment for prostate 
                        cancer may be improved;
                            (ii) the causes of prostate cancer may be 
                        discovered; and
                            (iii) a cure for prostate cancer may be 
                        developed; and
                    (C) to continue to consider ways for improving 
                access to, and the quality of, health care services for 
                detecting and treating prostate cancer; and
            (3) calls on the people of the United States, interested 
        groups, and affected persons--
                    (A) to promote awareness of prostate cancer;
                    (B) to take an active role in the fight to end the 
                devastating effects of prostate cancer on individuals, 
                families, and the economy; and
                    (C) to observe National Prostate Cancer Awareness 
                Month with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
                                 <all>
