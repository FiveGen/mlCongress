                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                           September 8, 2011

   Ms. Murkowski (for herself, Mr. Johnson of South Dakota, and Mr. 
 Begich) submitted the following resolution; which was considered and 
                               agreed to

                               RESOLUTION


 
  Designating September 9, 2011, as ``National Fetal Alcohol Spectrum 
                       Disorders Awareness Day''.

Whereas the term ``fetal alcohol spectrum disorders'' includes a broader range 
        of conditions than the term ``fetal alcohol syndrome'' and therefore has 
        replaced the term ``fetal alcohol syndrome'' as the umbrella term 
        describing the range of effects that can occur in an individual whose 
        mother drank alcohol during pregnancy;
Whereas fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are the leading cause of cognitive 
        disability in Western civilization, including the United States, and are 
        100 percent preventable;
Whereas fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are a major cause of numerous social 
        disorders, including learning disabilities, school failure, juvenile 
        delinquency, homelessness, unemployment, mental illness, and crime;
Whereas the incidence rate of fetal alcohol syndrome is estimated at 1 out of 
        500 live births and the incidence rate of fetal alcohol spectrum 
        disorders is estimated at 1 out of every 100 live births;
Whereas, although the economic costs of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are 
        difficult to estimate, the cost of fetal alcohol syndrome alone in the 
        United States was approximately $6,000,000,000 in 2007, and it is 
        estimated that each individual with fetal alcohol syndrome will cost the 
        taxpayers of the United States between $860,000 and $4,000,000 during 
        the lifetime of the individual;
Whereas, in February 1999, a small group of parents of children who suffer from 
        fetal alcohol spectrum disorders came together with the hope that they 
        could make the world aware of the devastating consequences of alcohol 
        consumption during pregnancy by establishing International Fetal Alcohol 
        Syndrome Awareness Day;
Whereas the first International Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Awareness Day was 
        observed on September 9, 1999;
Whereas Bonnie Buxton of Toronto, Canada, the co-founder of the first 
        International Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Awareness Day, asked ``What if ... 
        a world full of FAS/E [Fetal Alcohol Syndrome/Effect] parents all got 
        together on the ninth hour of the ninth day of the ninth month of the 
        year and asked the world to remember that during the 9 months of 
        pregnancy a woman should not consume alcohol ... would the rest of the 
        world listen?''; and
Whereas on the ninth day of the ninth month of each year since 1999, communities 
        around the world have observed International Fetal Alcohol Syndrome 
        Awareness Day: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates September 9, 2011, as ``National Fetal 
        Alcohol Spectrum Disorders Awareness Day''; and
            (2) calls upon the people of the United States--
                    (A) to observe National Fetal Alcohol Spectrum 
                Disorders Awareness Day with appropriate ceremonies--
                            (i) to promote awareness of the effects of 
                        prenatal exposure to alcohol;
                            (ii) to increase compassion for individuals 
                        affected by prenatal exposure to alcohol;
                            (iii) to minimize the effects of prenatal 
                        exposure to alcohol; and
                            (iv) to ensure healthier communities across 
                        the United States; and
                    (B) to observe a moment of reflection during the 
                ninth hour of September 9, 2011, to remember that 
                during the 9 months of pregnancy a woman should not 
                consume alcohol.
                                 <all>
