                               RESOLUTION


 
Commemorating the 225th anniversary of the signing of the Constitution 
of the United States and recognizing the contributions of the National 
Society of the Sons of the American Revolution and the National Society 
                 Daughters of the American Revolution.

Whereas the American Revolution secured the independence of the United States of 
        America and made possible the vibrant system of self-government of the 
        United States;
Whereas the supporters of the American Revolution, through their vision and 
        determination, enhanced the lives of countless individuals and made 
        possible the system of equal justice, limited government, and the rule 
        of law that exists in the United States;
Whereas the people who fought in the American Revolution made great sacrifices 
        for their fledgling country;
Whereas the 55 delegates who attended the Constitutional Convention in 
        Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 225 years ago, and the 39 delegates who 
        signed the Constitution of the United States at the Constitutional 
        Convention, irrevocably changed the course of history;
Whereas the Constitution of the United States, a revered and living document--

    (1) provides important rights to every citizen of the United States;

    (2) secures ``the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our 
Posterity''; and

    (3) sets the standard of democracy for the world;

Whereas the delegates to the Constitutional Convention in 1787 established the 
        imperative precedent of compromise;
Whereas the Constitution and the subsequent 27 amendments to the Constitution 
        outline the freedoms and the principles of representative government 
        that are as strong today as they were on that momentous occasion in 
        1787;
Whereas September 17, 2012, marks the 225th anniversary of the signing of the 
        Constitution of the United States, which is the supreme law of the land 
        and the document by which the people of the United States govern their 
        great country;
Whereas, to venerate the immeasurable importance of the Constitution and the day 
        on which the Constitution was signed, it is essential to continually 
        educate people about, and celebrate, the principles and legacy of the 
        Founding Fathers; and
Whereas members of organizations such as the National Society of the Sons of the 
        American Revolution and the National Society Daughters of the American 
        Revolution play an important role in promoting patriotism, preserving 
        the history of the United States, and educating the public about the 
        rights and responsibilities of citizenship: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) commemorates the 225th anniversary of the signing of 
        the Constitution of the United States on September 17, 2012, 
        and remembers the sacrifices made by the people who made the 
        signing possible; and
            (2) applauds the continuing contributions made by the 
        members, volunteers, and staff of historical, educational, and 
        patriotic societies of the United States, such as the National 
        Society of the Sons of the American Revolution and the National 
        Society Daughters of the American Revolution, in promoting 
        patriotism and the values embodied in the Constitution of the 
        United States.
                                 <all>
