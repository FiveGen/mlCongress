                           September 26, 2011

Mr. Coons (for himself, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Bingaman, Ms. Stabenow, and 
Mr. Pryor) submitted the following resolution; which was considered and 
                               agreed to

                               RESOLUTION


 
      Designating the year of 2011 as the ``International Year of 
                              Chemistry''.

Whereas the United Nations has designated the year of 2011 as the International 
        Year of Chemistry and is holding a worldwide celebration called 
        ``Chemistry--Our Life, Our Future'', which recognizes the achievements 
        made in the field of chemistry and the contributions of those 
        achievements to the well-being of humankind;
Whereas the science of chemistry is vital to the improvement of human life 
        because of its power to transform;
Whereas chemistry provides solutions that successfully address global challenges 
        involving safe food and water, alternate sources of energy, improved 
        health, and a healthy and sustainable environment;
Whereas the members of chemical enterprise and industry, scientific societies, 
        and academia in the United States, and the Government of the United 
        States, generate important contributions to the economy of the United 
        States, and energize the scientific and technological base with critical 
        innovations;
Whereas 2011 represents the 100\th\ anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize 
        to Marie Curie for the second time, the first time that an individual 
        had received a second Nobel Prize;
Whereas Marie Curie has inspired generations of scientists to excel in their 
        fields;
Whereas the purpose of the ``Chemistry--Our Life, Our Future'' celebration is to 
        increase public appreciation of chemistry in meeting world needs, to 
        further the development of science, technology, engineering, and 
        mathematics education at all levels, and to encourage interest in 
        chemistry among young people in order to create a future corps of 
        innovators;
Whereas exciting new practices of sustainable green chemistry incorporate design 
        processes to maximize the amount of raw material that ends up in the end 
        product, use safe, environmentally benign substances, including 
        solvents, design energy efficient processes, and minimize waste disposal 
        by not creating it in the first place; and
Whereas during the year of 2011, countries and organizations will reach out to 
        adults and children through symposia, conferences, demonstrations, 
        workshops, contests, school activities, exhibitions, and other public 
        events to increase awareness of the history and importance of chemistry: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates the year of 2011 as the ``International Year 
        of Chemistry'';
            (2) supports the goals of the International Year of 
        Chemistry;
            (3) recognizes the necessity of educating the public on the 
        merits of the sciences, including chemistry, and promoting 
        interest in the sciences among the youth of the United States; 
        and
            (4) encourages the people of the United States to 
        participate in the International Year of Chemistry through 
        appropriate recognition of programs, activities, and ceremonies 
        that call attention to the importance of chemistry to our well-
        being in the present and the future.
                                 <all>
