                               RESOLUTION


 
  Commending the Pacific Lutheran University Lutes Softball Team for 
winning the 2012 National Collegiate Athletic Association Division III 
                         Softball Championship.

Whereas, on May 21, 2012, the Pacific Lutheran University Lutes (referred to in 
        this preamble as ``the PLU Lutes'') Softball Team defeated the Linfield 
        College Wildcats by a score of 3-0 to win the National Collegiate 
        Athletic Association Division III Softball Championship;
Whereas this victory is the first softball championship for Pacific Lutheran 
        University in its history, as well as its first national championship 
        since 1999;
Whereas the PLU Lutes Softball Team finished the 2012 season with a record of 45 
        wins and 11 losses, breaking the record at Pacific Lutheran University 
        for most wins in a season;
Whereas the PLU Lutes Softball Team also broke the school record for most runs 
        scored and most total bases in a season;
Whereas senior pitcher Stacy Hagensen was named the tournament's Most 
        Outstanding Player by allowing only 3 hits and giving up no runs;
Whereas the team members and coaches of the PLU Lutes Softball Team have set an 
        example of leadership for women in collegiate athletics;
Whereas PLU Lutes Softball Team head coach Erin Van Nostrand, associate head 
        coach Greg Seeley, and assistant coaches Tiffany McVay, Dena Harkovitch, 
        and Dena Slye led the team to the championship with their leadership and 
        winning philosophy;
Whereas the PLU Lutes Softball Team exemplifies the mission of title IX of the 
        Education Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.) (referred to in 
        this preamble as ``Title IX''), which Congress enacted to ensure that 
        gender discrimination did not interfere with educational opportunities;
Whereas the passage of Title IX has led to a 574 percent increase in female 
        participation in college sports and a 1,000 percent increase in female 
        participation in high school sports;
Whereas, before Title IX, only 2 percent of the college students participating 
        in sports were female;
Whereas, in 2001, 43 percent of the college students participating in sports 
        were female;
Whereas, by a 3-1 ratio, female athletes perform better in school and have 
        higher graduation rates than females who do not participate in sports;
Whereas student-athletes have higher annual graduation rates than their 
        classmates who do not participate in sports; and
Whereas the success of the 2012 PLU Lutes Softball Team demonstrates the 
        accomplishments that a team can achieve when each player adopts a 
        teamwork mentality: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) commends the Pacific Lutheran University Lutes 
        (referred to in this resolution as the ``PLU Lutes'') Softball 
        Team for winning the 2012 National Collegiate Athletic 
        Association Division III Softball Championship;
            (2) recognizes the people of Washington State for their 
        support of the PLU Lutes Softball Team;
            (3) honors the achievements of every player, coach, and 
        support staff who was instrumental in the success of the PLU 
        Lutes Softball Team during the 2012 season; and
            (4) requests the Secretary of the Senate to transmit an 
        enrolled copy of this resolution for appropriate display to the 
        PLU Lutes Softball Team.
