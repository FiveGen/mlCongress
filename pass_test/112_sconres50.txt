                      One Hundred Twelfth Congress

                                 of the

                        United States of America


                          AT THE SECOND SESSION

          Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday,

                          Concurrent Resolution

Whereas given the importance of the Internet to the global economy, it 
  is essential that the Internet remain stable, secure, and free from 
  government control;

Whereas the world deserves the access to knowledge, services, commerce, 
  and communication, the accompanying benefits to economic development, 
  education, and health care, and the informed discussion that is the 
  bedrock of democratic self-government that the Internet provides;

Whereas the structure of Internet governance has profound implications 
  for competition and trade, democratization, free expression, and 
  access to information;

Whereas countries have obligations to protect human rights, which are 
  advanced by online activity as well as offline activity;

Whereas the ability to innovate, develop technical capacity, grasp 
  economic opportunities, and promote freedom of expression online is 
  best realized in cooperation with all stakeholders;

Whereas proposals have been put forward for consideration at the 2012 
  World Conference on International Telecommunications that would 
  fundamentally alter the governance and operation of the Internet;

Whereas the proposals, in international bodies such as the United 
  Nations General Assembly, the United Nations Commission on Science 
  and Technology for Development, and the International 
  Telecommunication Union, would attempt to justify increased 
  government control over the Internet and would undermine the current 
  multistakeholder model that has enabled the Internet to flourish and 
  under which the private sector, civil society, academia, and 
  individual users play an important role in charting its direction;

Whereas the proposals would diminish the freedom of expression on the 
  Internet in favor of government control over content;

Whereas the position of the United States Government has been and is to 
  advocate for the flow of information free from government control; 
  and

Whereas this and past Administrations have made a strong commitment to 
  the multistakeholder model of Internet governance and the promotion 
  of the global benefits of the Internet: Now, therefore, be it

    Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring), 
That it is the sense of Congress that the Secretary of State, in 
consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, should continue working to 
implement the position of the United States on Internet governance that 
clearly articulates the consistent and unequivocal policy of the United 
States to promote a global Internet free from government control and 
preserve and advance the successful multistakeholder model that governs 
the Internet today.
Attest:

                                               Secretary of the Senate.
Attest:

                                 Clerk of the House of Representatives.
