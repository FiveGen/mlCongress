                               RESOLUTION


 
To express the sense of the Senate in support of reducing its budget by 
                          at least 5 percent.

Whereas, the current level Federal spending is unsustainable and action to 
        reverse this course should not be delayed;
Whereas, in 2010, Federal spending was nearly 24 percent of the value of all the 
        goods and services produced in the United States;
Whereas, the Federal deficit was over $1 trillion in fiscal year 2010;
Whereas, Federal spending is at its highest percentage since World War II;
Whereas, the Congressional Budget Office estimates if the United States 
        maintains its current track of Federal spending, the Federal debt would 
        reach 90 percent of the value of all the goods and services produced in 
        the United States by 2020;
Whereas, the national debt exceeds $13.9 trillion dollars;
Whereas, the United States borrows $44,000 for every person in the country;
Whereas, the unemployment rate was 9.8 percent in December;
Whereas, the American people have responded to the economic downturn by making 
        hard choices and trimming their family budgets;
Whereas, spending in the legislative branch rose nearly 50 percent over the last 
        10 years; and
Whereas, in order to address the Nation's fiscal crisis, the Senate should lead 
        by example and reduce its own legislative budget: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that it should lead by 
example and reduce the budget of the Senate by at least 5 percent.
                                 <all>
