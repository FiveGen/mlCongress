                               RESOLUTION


 
 Designating October 7, 2012, as ``Operation Enduring Freedom Veterans 
                                 Day''.

Whereas the initial volley of Operation Enduring Freedom took place in 
        Afghanistan on October 7, 2001, and October 7, 2012, marks the eleventh 
        anniversary of the war;
Whereas Operation Enduring Freedom, launched in response to the terrorist 
        attacks committed against the United States on September 11, 2001, 
        targeted al-Qaida and the Taliban protectors of al-Qaida in Afghanistan;
Whereas Operation Enduring Freedom is the longest ongoing war in which the 
        United States is involved;
Whereas the wounded warriors who have served in Operation Enduring Freedom carry 
        the scars of war, both seen and unseen;
Whereas some 2,000 patriots in the United States Armed Forces have made the 
        ultimate sacrifice while serving in Afghanistan;
Whereas the war in Afghanistan should not fade from the hearts and minds of the 
        people of the United States; and
Whereas the ongoing sacrifices made by the men and women of the Armed Forces 
        should be recognized and honored: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates October 7, 2012, as ``Operation Enduring 
        Freedom Veterans Day'';
            (2) honors the brave men and women who gave their lives 
        while serving the United States in Operation Enduring Freedom; 
        and
            (3) encourages the people of the United States to salute 
        the more than half a million men and women who have served 
        bravely in Afghanistan to preserve our shared security and 
        freedom.
