                               RESOLUTION


 
          Designating April 21, 2011, as ``PowerTalk 21 Day''.

Whereas the goal of PowerTalk 21 Day is to encourage parents and caregivers to 
        embrace their important role in influencing the decisions of the young 
        people of the United States about drinking alcohol;
Whereas high school students who use alcohol or other substances are 5 times 
        more likely to drop out of school or believe good grades are not 
        important;
Whereas teen alcohol use kills about 6,000 people each year, more than all other 
        illegal drugs combined; and
Whereas 74 percent of kids say that their parents are their primary influence 
        when it comes to decisions about drinking alcohol: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates April 21, 2011, as ``PowerTalk 21 Day'';
            (2) recognizes the importance of parents talking with their 
        teens about alcohol; and
            (3) urges all people of the United States to join in the 
        efforts to raise awareness of the importance of parents and 
        teens talking together about alcohol in order to reduce the 
        risks and dangers posed to teens and communities by underage 
        drinking.
