                               RESOLUTION


 
   Designating December 10, 2011, as ``Wreaths Across America Day''.

Whereas 20 years ago, the Wreaths Across America project began an annual 
        tradition, during the month of December, of donating, transporting, and 
        placing Maine balsam fir holiday wreaths on the graves of the fallen 
        heroes buried at Arlington National Cemetery;
Whereas since that tradition began, through the hard work and generosity of the 
        individuals involved in the Wreaths Across America project, more than 
        250,000 wreaths have been sent to more than 700 locations, including 
        national cemeteries and veterans memorials in every State and to 
        locations overseas;
Whereas in 2010, wreaths were sent to more than 520 locations across the United 
        States and overseas, 100 more locations than the previous year;
Whereas in December 2011, the Patriot Guard Riders, a motorcycle and motor 
        vehicle group that is dedicated to patriotic events and includes more 
        than 250,000 members nationwide, will continue their tradition of 
        escorting a tractor-trailer filled with donated wreaths from Harrington, 
        Maine, to Arlington National Cemetery;
Whereas thousands of individuals volunteer each December to escort and lay the 
        wreaths;
Whereas December 11, 2010, was previously designated by the Senate as ``Wreaths 
        Across America Day''; and
Whereas the Wreaths Across America project will continue its proud legacy on 
        December 10, 2011, bringing 75,000 wreaths to Arlington National 
        Cemetery on that day: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates December 10, 2011, as ``Wreaths Across 
        America Day'';
            (2) honors the Wreaths Across America project, the Patriot 
        Guard Riders, and all of the volunteers and donors involved in 
        this worthy tradition; and
            (3) recognizes the sacrifices our veterans, members of the 
        Armed Forces, and their families have made, and continue to 
        make, for our great Nation.
