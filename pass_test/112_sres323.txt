                               RESOLUTION


 
 Recognizing the 75th Anniversary of the Welfare Program of The Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the significant impact of the 
   Welfare Program in the United States and throughout the world in 
                        helping people in need.

Whereas in 1936, while the United States was mired in the Great Depression, 
        Heber J. Grant, President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
        Saints (referred to in this Resolution as ``the LDS Church''), announced 
        the creation of what came to be known as the Welfare Program;
Whereas President Grant explained, ``Our primary purpose was to set up . . . a 
        system under which the curse of idleness would be done away with, the 
        evils of a dole abolished, and independence, industry, thrift and self 
        respect be once more established amongst our people . . . The aim of the 
        Church is to help the people to help themselves. Work is to be re-
        enthroned as the ruling principle of the lives of our Church 
        membership.'';
Whereas, the LDS Church's Welfare Program, which is based on the principles of 
        self-reliance and industry, has expanded throughout the world and 
        assists people of all faiths by caring for the needy while 
        simultaneously teaching principles to help them become self-reliant and 
        retain their self respect;
Whereas funding for the LDS Church's Welfare Program is provided by the members 
        of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, who routinely fast 
        for 2 consecutive meals every month and make donations to the LDS 
        Church's Welfare Program that is at least equal to the money they would 
        have spent on food;
Whereas the LDS Church's Welfare Program provides opportunities for members of 
        The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to help the less 
        fortunate by working at dozens of farms and canneries located throughout 
        the United States and Canada that produce food for needy people;
Whereas needy people in the community are identified by the leader of each local 
        church congregation, in consultation with other local leaders, including 
        the Relief Society President (a woman from the congregation who serves 
        as the local leader of the LDS Church's women's organization);
Whereas people in need are provided free food and household items at facilities 
        called Bishop's Storehouses after receiving a written requisition from 
        the leader of their local congregation;
Whereas the 129 Bishop's Storehouses, which are located throughout the world, 
        provide needed commodities from the consecrated sacrifices of members of 
        The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints;
Whereas recipients of these commodities are given service opportunities, to the 
        extent of their ability, which allow them to demonstrate their gratitude 
        for what they have received;
Whereas employment resource service centers, which are also part of the LDS 
        Church's Welfare Program, provide a place where people can receive job 
        training, learn to enhance their resumes, and find job opportunities;
Whereas there are nearly 300 employment resource service centers throughout the 
        world, at which volunteers help hundreds of thousands of people to find 
        jobs every year, a large percentage of whom are not members of The 
        Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints;
Whereas the LDS Church's Welfare Program also includes Deseret Industries, which 
        serves as an employment training facility and operates thrift stores;
Whereas these thrift stores provide on-the-job experience for refugees or others 
        who need help qualifying for long-term employment and are stocked by 
        individual donations, which are offered to the public at inexpensive 
        prices;
Whereas the LDS Church's Welfare Program also includes LDS Family Services, a 
        private, nonprofit organization that provides counseling, adoption 
        services, addiction recovery support groups, and resources for social, 
        emotional, and spiritual challenges;
Whereas the influence and power for good exerted by the Welfare Program of the 
        LDS Church has greatly expanded over its 75-year history; and
Whereas the positive impact of the LDS Church's Welfare Program in the United 
        States has assisted untold numbers of United States citizens:
Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes the 75th Anniversary of the Welfare Program 
        of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints;
            (2) congratulates the members of The Church of Jesus Christ 
        of Latter-day Saints for the significant contribution that its 
        Welfare Program has had on United States citizens and many 
        people throughout the world; and
            (3) commends the many efforts made by The Church of Jesus 
        Christ of Latter-day Saints and its members, through its 
        Welfare Program, to serve others regardless of religious 
        affiliation.
