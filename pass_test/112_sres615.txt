                               RESOLUTION


 
  Congratulating the recipients of the 2012 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.

Whereas the Nobel Prize is an international award administered by the Nobel 
        Foundation in Stockholm, Sweden;
Whereas the Nobel Prize has been awarded for outstanding achievements in 
        physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature, and peace since 
        1901;
Whereas the Nobel Prize in Chemistry is awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of 
        Sciences in Stockholm, Sweden to recognize scientific advancements that 
        have increased our understanding of chemical processes and their 
        molecular basis;
Whereas the 2012 Nobel Prize in Chemistry is awarded jointly to Robert J. 
        Lefkowitz, M.D., a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator and 
        James B. Duke Professor of Medicine and Biochemistry at Duke University 
        Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina, and Brian K. Kobilka, M.D., 
        Professor and Chair of Molecular and Cellular Physiology at the Stanford 
        University School of Medicine in Stanford, California, for their studies 
        on G-protein-coupled receptors;
Whereas G-protein-coupled receptors are a class of cell surface receptors that 
        catch chemical signals from the outside and transmit their messages into 
        the cell, providing the cell with information about changes occurring 
        within the body;
Whereas the studies completed by Robert J. Lefkowitz, M.D., and Brian K. 
        Kobilka, M.D., have significantly advanced our scientific understanding 
        of G-protein-coupled receptors and their functions;
Whereas the groundbreaking discoveries made by Robert J. Lefkowitz, M.D., and 
        Brian K. Kobilka, M.D., have made it possible to target and treat 
        diseases more precisely and effectively, as nearly half of all medicines 
        used in the world are aimed at G-protein-coupled receptors;
Whereas the National Institutes of Health supported the work done by Robert J. 
        Lefkowitz, M.D., and Brian K. Kobilka, M.D., through research grants 
        with the goal of advancing scientific knowledge and improving public 
        health; and
Whereas the accomplishments and discoveries of Robert J. Lefkowitz, M.D., and 
        Brian K. Kobilka, M.D., are significant achievements in the field of 
        scientific and medical research and further promote the United States as 
        a world leader in science: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) congratulates the recipients of the 2012 Nobel Prize in 
        Chemistry, which is awarded for their outstanding scientific 
        achievements and discoveries; and
            (2) recognizes Duke University Medical Center in Durham, 
        North Carolina, and the Stanford University School of Medicine 
        in Stanford, California for their leadership role in advancing 
        medical research.
                                 <all>
