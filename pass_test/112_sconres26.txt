                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION

Whereas the year of 2011 is recognized as the ``International Year for People of 
        African Descent'';
Whereas the African Diaspora is expansive, spanning the globe from Latin America 
        and the Caribbean to Asia, with persons of African descent living on 
        every continent, including Europe;
Whereas in recognition of the African Diaspora, on December 18, 2009, the United 
        Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 64/169, designating the year 
        of 2011 as the ``International Year for People of African Descent'';
Whereas the historical bonds and shared experiences that tie the African 
        continent with the world must be recalled;
Whereas the global contributions of people of African descent must be recognized 
        as a means of preserving that heritage;
Whereas a central goal of recognizing the year of 2011 as the International Year 
        for People of African descent is to strengthen national actions and 
        regional and international cooperation for the benefit of people of 
        African descent in relation to--

    (1) the full enjoyment of economic, cultural, social, civil, and 
political rights for people of African descent;

    (2) the participation and integration of people of African descent in 
all political, economic, social, and cultural aspects of society; and

    (3) the promotion of greater knowledge of, and respect for, the diverse 
heritage and culture of people of African descent; and

Whereas the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, 
        done at Helsinki August 1, 1975, states that ``participating States will 
        respect human rights and fundamental freedoms . . . for all without 
        distinction as to race, sex, language or religion'': Now, therefore, be 
        it
    Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring), 
That Congress--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of the designation of the 
        year of 2011 as the International Year for People of African 
        Descent;
            (2) encourages the recognition and celebration of the 
        collective history and achievements made by people of African 
        descent;
            (3) reaffirms the importance of inclusion and the full and 
        equal participation of people of African descent around the 
        world in all aspects of political, economic, social, and 
        cultural life;
            (4) recognizes bilateral and multilateral efforts to 
        promote democracy, human rights, and rule of law, including 
        those efforts that target the eradication of poverty, hunger, 
        and inequality; and
            (5) reaffirms the commitment of Congress to address racism, 
        discrimination, and intolerance in the United States and around 
        the globe.

            Passed the Senate

            Attest:

                                                             Secretary.
