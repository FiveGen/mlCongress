                               RESOLUTION


 
Recognizing that the occurrence of prostate cancer in African-American 
  men has reached epidemic proportions and urging Federal agencies to 
address that health crisis by supporting education, awareness outreach, 
   and research specifically focused on how prostate cancer affects 
                         African-American men.

Whereas the incidence of prostate cancer in African-American men is more than 
        one and a half times higher than in any other racial or ethnic group in 
        the United States;
Whereas African-American men have the highest mortality rate of any ethnic and 
        racial group in the United States, dying at a rate that is approximately 
        two and a half times higher than other ethnic and racial groups;
Whereas that rate of mortality represents the largest disparity of mortality 
        rates in any of the major cancers;
Whereas prostate cancer can be cured with early detection and the proper 
        treatment, regardless of the ethnic or racial group of the cancer 
        patient;
Whereas African Americans are more likely to be diagnosed at an earlier age and 
        at a later stage of cancer progression than all other ethnic and racial 
        groups, leading to lower cure rates and lower chances of survival;
Whereas, for patients diagnosed early, studies show a 5-year survival rate of 
        nearly 100 percent, but the survival rate drops significantly to 28 
        percent for patients diagnosed in late stages; and
Whereas recent genomics research has increased the ability to identify men at 
        high risk for aggressive prostate cancer: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes that prostate cancer has created a health 
        crisis for African-American men;
            (2) recognizes the importance of health coverage and access 
        to care, as well as promoting informed decisionmaking between 
        men and their doctors, taking into consideration the known 
        risks and potential benefits of screening and treatment options 
        for prostate cancer;
            (3) urges Federal agencies to support--
                    (A) research to address and attempt to end the 
                health crisis created by prostate cancer;
                    (B) efforts relating to education, awareness, and 
                early detection at the grassroots level to end that 
                health crisis; and
                    (C) the Office of Minority Health of the Department 
                of Health and Human Services in focusing on improving 
                health and healthcare outcomes for African Americans at 
                an elevated risk of prostate cancer; and
            (4) urges investment by Federal agencies in research 
        focusing on the improvement of early detection and treatment of 
        prostate cancer, such as the use of--
                    (A) biomarkers to accurately distinguish indolent 
                forms of prostate cancer from lethal forms; and
                    (B) advanced imaging tools to ensure the best level 
                of individualized patient care.
