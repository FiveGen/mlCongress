                        annual increases.--In the case of any pre-FIRM 
                        property (as such term is defined in section 
                        578(b) of the National Flood Insurance Reform

        Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency as at 
        high-risk for flooding or special flood hazard areas.
    (c) Duties.--
            (1) New mapping standards.--Not later than the expiration 
        of the 12-month period beginning upon the date of the enactment 
        of this Act, the Council shall develop and submit to the 
        Administrator and the Congress proposed new mapping standards 
        for 100-year flood insurance rate maps used under the national 
        flood insurance program under the National Flood Insurance Act 
        of 1968. In developing such proposed standards the Council 
        shall--
                    (A) ensure that the flood insurance rate maps 
                reflect true risk, including graduated risk that better 
                reflects the financial risk to each property; such 
                reflection of risk should be at the smallest geographic 
                level possible (but not necessarily property-by-
                property) to ensure that communities are mapped in a 
                manner that takes into consideration different risk 
                levels within the community;
                    (B) ensure the most efficient generation, display, 
                and distribution of flood risk data, models, and maps 
                where practicable through dynamic digital environments 
                using spatial database technology and the Internet;
                    (C) ensure that flood insurance rate maps reflect 
                current hydrologic and hydraulic data, current land 
                use, and topography, incorporating the most current and 
                accurate ground and bathymetric elevation data;
                    (D) determine the best ways to include in such 
                flood insurance rate maps levees, decertified levees, 
                and areas located below dams, including determining a 
                methodology for ensuring that decertified levees and 
                other protections are included in flood insurance rate 
                maps and their corresponding flood zones reflect the 
                level of protection conferred;
                    (E) consider how to incorporate restored wetlands 
                and other natural buffers into flood insurance rate 
                maps, which may include wetlands, groundwater recharge 
                areas, erosion zones, meander belts, endangered species 
                habitat, barrier islands and shoreline buffer features, 
                riparian forests, and other features;
                    (F) consider whether to use vertical positioning 
                (as defined by the Administrator) for flood insurance 
                rate maps;
                    (G) ensure that flood insurance rate maps 
                differentiate between a property that is located in a 
                flood zone and a structure located on such property 
                that is not at the same risk level for flooding as such 
                property due to the elevation of the structure;
                    (H) ensure that flood insurance rate maps take into 
                consideration the best scientific data and potential 
                future conditions (including projections for sea level 
                rise); and
                    (I) consider how to incorporate the new standards 
                proposed pursuant to this paragraph in existing mapping 
                efforts.
            (2) Ongoing duties.--The Council shall, on an ongoing 
        basis, review the mapping protocols developed pursuant to 
        paragraph (1), and make recommendations to the Administrator 
        when the Council determines that mapping protocols should be 
        altered.
            (3) Meetings.--In carrying out its duties under this 
        section, the Council shall consult with stakeholders through at 
        least 4 public meetings annually, and shall seek input of all 
        stakeholder interests including State and local 
        representatives, environmental and conservation organizations, 
        insurance industry representatives, advocacy groups, planning 
        organizations, and mapping organizations.
    (d) Prohibition on Compensation.--Members of the Council shall 
receive no additional compensation by reason of their service on the 
Council.
    (e) Chairperson.--The Administrator shall serve as the Chairperson 
of the Council.
    (f) Staff.--
            (1) FEMA.--Upon the request of the Council, the 
        Administrator may detail, on a nonreimbursable basis, personnel 
        of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to assist the 
        Council in carrying out its duties.
            (2) Other federal agencies.--Upon request of the Council, 
        any other Federal agency that is a member of the Council may 
        detail, on a non-reimbursable basis, personnel to assist the 
        Council in carrying out its duties.

        Act of 1973 (42 U.S.C. 4012a), and section 202(a) of such Act, 
        shall not apply to a property located in an area designated as 
        having a special flood hazard if the owner of such property 
        submits to the Administrator an elevation certificate for such 
        property showing that the lowest level of the primary residence 
        on such property is at an elevation that is at least three feet 
        higher than the elevation of the 100-year flood plain.
            (2) Review of certificate.--The Administrator shall accept 
        as conclusive each elevation certificate submitted under 
        paragraph (1) unless the Administrator conducts a subsequent 
        elevation survey and determines that the lowest level of the 
        primary residence on the property in question is not at an 
        elevation that is at least three feet higher than the elevation 
        of the 100-year flood plain. The Administrator shall provide 
        any such subsequent elevation survey to the owner of such 
        property.
            (3) Determinations for properties on borders of special 
        flood hazard areas.--
                    (A) Expedited determination.--In the case of any 
                survey for a property submitted to the Administrator 
                pursuant to paragraph (1) showing that a portion of the 
                property is located within an area having special flood 
                hazards and that a structure located on the property is 
                not located within such area having special flood 
                hazards, the Administrator shall expeditiously process 
                any request made by an owner of the property for a 
                determination pursuant to paragraph (2) or a 
                determination of whether the structure is located 
                within the area having special flood hazards.
                    (B) Prohibition of fee.--If the Administrator 
                determines pursuant to subparagraph (A) that the 
                structure on the property is not located within the 
                area having special flood hazards, the Administrator 
                shall not charge a fee for reviewing the flood hazard 
                data and shall not require the owner to provide any 
                additional elevation data.
                    (C) Simplification of review process.--The 
                Administrator shall collaborate with private sector 
                flood insurers to simplify the review process for 
                properties described in subparagraph (A) and to ensure 
                that the review process provides for accurate 
                determinations.
            (4) Termination of authority.--This subsection shall cease 
        to apply to a property on the date on which the Administrator 
        updates the flood insurance rate map that applies to such 
        property in accordance with the requirements of subsection (d).

        proposals to assume a portion of the program's insurance risk 
        and submit to the Congress a report describing the response to 
        such request for proposals and the results of such assessment.

following new section:

``SEC. 1310A. RESERVE FUND.

    ``(a) Establishment of Reserve Fund.--In carrying out the flood 
insurance program authorized by this title, the Administrator shall 
establish in the Treasury of the United States a National Flood 
Insurance Reserve Fund (in this section referred to as the `Reserve 
Fund') which shall--
            ``(1) be an account separate from any other accounts or 
        funds available to the Administrator; and
            ``(2) be available for meeting the expected future 
        obligations of the flood insurance program.
    ``(b) Reserve Ratio.--Subject to the phase-in requirements under 
subsection (d), the Reserve Fund shall maintain a balance equal to--
            ``(1) 1 percent of the sum of the total potential loss 
        exposure of all outstanding flood insurance policies in force 
        in the prior fiscal year; or
            ``(2) such higher percentage as the Administrator 
        determines to be appropriate, taking into consideration any 
        circumstance that may raise a significant risk of substantial 
        future losses to the Reserve Fund.
    ``(c) Maintenance of Reserve Ratio.--
            ``(1) In general.--The Administrator shall have the 
        authority to establish, increase, or decrease the amount of 
        aggregate annual insurance premiums to be collected for any 
        fiscal year necessary--
                    ``(A) to maintain the reserve ratio required under 
                subsection (b); and
                    ``(B) to achieve such reserve ratio, if the actual 
                balance of such reserve is below the amount required 
                under subsection (b).
            ``(2) Considerations.--In exercising the authority under 
        paragraph (1), the Administrator shall consider--
                    ``(A) the expected operating expenses of the 
                Reserve Fund;
                    ``(B) the insurance loss expenditures under the 
                flood insurance program;
                    ``(C) any investment income generated under the 
                flood insurance program; and
                    ``(D) any other factor that the Administrator 
                determines appropriate.
            ``(3) Limitations.--In exercising the authority under 
        paragraph (1), the Administrator shall be subject to all other 
        provisions of this Act, including any provisions relating to 
        chargeable premium rates and annual increases of such rates.
    ``(d) Phase-in Requirements.--The phase-in requirements under this 
subsection are as follows:
            ``(1) In general.--Beginning in fiscal year 2012 and not 
        ending until the fiscal year in which the ratio required under 
        subsection (b) is achieved, in each such fiscal year the 
        Administrator shall place in the Reserve Fund an amount equal 
        to not less than 7.5 percent of the reserve ratio required 
        under subsection (b).
            ``(2) Amount satisfied.--As soon as the ratio required 
        under subsection (b) is achieved, and except as provided in 
        paragraph (3), the Administrator shall not be required to set 
        aside any amounts for the Reserve Fund.
            ``(3) Exception.--If at any time after the ratio required 
        under subsection (b) is achieved, the Reserve Fund falls below 
        the required ratio under subsection (b), the Administrator 
        shall place in the Reserve Fund for that fiscal year an amount 
        equal to not less than 7.5 percent of the reserve ratio 
        required under subsection (b).
    ``(e) Limitation on Reserve Ratio.--In any given fiscal year, if 
the Administrator determines that the reserve ratio required under 
subsection (b) cannot be achieved, the Administrator shall submit a 
report to the Congress that--
            ``(1) describes and details the specific concerns of the 
        Administrator regarding such consequences;
            ``(2) demonstrates how such consequences would harm the 
        long-term financial soundness of the flood insurance program; 
        and
            ``(3) indicates the maximum attainable reserve ratio for 
        that particular fiscal year.
    ``(f) Availability of Amounts.--The reserve ratio requirements 
under subsection (b) and the phase-in requirements under subsection (d) 
shall be subject to the availability of amounts in the National Flood 
Insurance Fund for transfer under section 1310(a)(10), as provided in 
section 1310(f).''.

            (7) the impact of such a building code requirement on rural 
        communities with different building code challenges than more 
        urban environments; and
            (8) the impact of such a building code requirement on 
        Indian reservations.

SEC. 31. STUDY ON GRADUATED RISK.

    (a) Study.--The National Academy of Sciences shall conduct a study 
exploring methods for understanding graduated risk behind levees and 
the associated land development, insurance, and risk communication 
dimensions, which shall--
            (1) research, review, and recommend current best practices 
        for estimating direct annualized flood losses behind levees for 
        residential and commercial structures;
            (2) rank such practices based on their best value, 
        balancing cost, scientific integrity, and the inherent 
        uncertainties associated with all aspects of the loss estimate, 
        including geotechnical engineering, flood frequency estimates, 
        economic value, and direct damages;
            (3) research, review, and identify current best floodplain 
        management and land use practices behind levees that 
        effectively balance social, economic, and environmental 
        considerations as part of an overall flood risk management 
        strategy;
            (4) identify examples where such practices have proven 
        effective and recommend methods and processes by which they 
        could be applied more broadly across the United States, given 
        the variety of different flood risks, State and local legal 
        frameworks, and evolving judicial opinions;
            (5) research, review, and identify a variety of flood 
        insurance pricing options for flood hazards behind levees which 
        are actuarially sound and based on the flood risk data 
        developed using the top three best value approaches identified 
        pursuant to paragraph (1);
            (6) evaluate and recommend methods to reduce insurance 
        costs through creative arrangements between insureds and 
        insurers while keeping a clear accounting of how much financial 
        risk is being borne by various parties such that the entire 
        risk is accounted for, including establishment of explicit 
        limits on disaster aid or other assistance in the event of a 
        flood; and
            (7) taking into consideration the recommendations pursuant 
        to paragraphs (1) through (3), recommend approaches to 
        communicating the associated risks to community officials, 
        homeowners, and other residents.
    (b) Report.--Not later than the expiration of the 12-month period 
beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act, the National 
Academy of Sciences shall submit a report to the Committees on 
Financial Services and Science, Space, and Technology of the House of 
Representatives and the Committees on Banking, Housing, and Urban 
Affairs and Commerce, Science and Transportation of the Senate on the 
study under subsection (a) including the information and 
recommendations required under such subsection.

SEC. 32. REPORT ON FLOOD-IN-PROGRESS DETERMINATION.

    The Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency shall 
review the processes and procedures for determining that a flood event 
has commenced or is in progress for purposes of flood insurance 
coverage made available under the national flood insurance program 
under the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 and for providing public 
notification that such an event has commenced or is in progress. In 
such review, the Administrator shall take into consideration the 
effects and implications that weather conditions, such as rainfall, 
snowfall, projected snowmelt, existing water levels, and other 
conditions have on the determination that a flood event has commenced 
or is in progress. Not later than the expiration of the 6-month period 
beginning upon the date of the enactment of this Act, the Administrator 
shall submit a report to the Congress setting forth the results and 
conclusions of the review undertaken pursuant to this section and any 
actions undertaken or proposed actions to be taken to provide for a 
more precise and technical determination that a flooding event has 
commenced or is in progress.

SEC. 33. STUDY ON REPAYING FLOOD INSURANCE DEBT.

    Not later than the expiration of the 6-month period beginning on 
the date of the enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency shall submit a report to the Congress 
setting forth a plan for repaying within 10 years all amounts, 
including any amounts previously borrowed but not yet repaid, owed 
pursuant to clause (2) of subsection (a) of section 1309 of the 
National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4016(a)(2)).

SEC. 34. NO CAUSE OF ACTION.

    No cause of action shall exist and no claim may be brought against 
the United States for violation of any notification requirement imposed
