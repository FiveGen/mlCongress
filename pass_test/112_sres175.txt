                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing the sense of the Senate with respect to ongoing violations 
    of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Georgia and the 
  importance of a peaceful and just resolution to the conflict within 
             Georgia's internationally recognized borders.

Whereas, since 1993, the territorial integrity of Georgia has been reaffirmed by 
        the international community and 36 United Nations Security Council 
        resolutions;
Whereas the United States-Georgia Strategic Charter, signed on January 9, 2009, 
        underscores that ``support for each other's sovereignty, independence, 
        territorial integrity and inviolability of borders constitutes the 
        foundation of our bilateral relations'';
Whereas, in October 2010, at the meeting of the United States-Georgia Charter on 
        Strategic Partnership, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stated, ``The 
        United States will not waiver in its support for Georgia's sovereignty 
        and territorial integrity.'';
Whereas the White House released a fact sheet on July 24, 2010, calling for 
        ``Russia to end its occupation of the Georgian territories of Abkhazia 
        and South Ossetia'' and for ``a return of international observers to the 
        two occupied regions of Georgia'';
Whereas Vice President Joseph Biden stated in Tbilisi in July 2009 that the 
        United States ``will not recognize Abkhazia and South Ossetia as 
        independent states'';
Whereas, according to the Government of Georgia's ``State Strategy on Occupied 
        Territories,'' the Government of Georgia has committed itself to a 
        policy of peaceful engagement, the protection of economic and human 
        rights, freedom of movement, and the preservation of cultural heritage, 
        language, and identity for the people of Abkhazia and South Ossetia;
Whereas the August 2008 conflict between the Governments of Russia and Georgia 
        resulted in civilian and military causalities, the violation of the 
        sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia, and large numbers of 
        internally displaced persons;
Whereas large numbers of persons remain displaced as a result of the August 2008 
        conflict as well as the earlier conflicts of the 1990s;
Whereas the August 12, 2008, ceasefire agreement, agreed to by the Governments 
        of Russia and Georgia provides that all troops of the Russian Federation 
        shall be withdrawn to pre-conflict positions;
Whereas the August 12, 2008, ceasefire agreement provides that free access shall 
        be granted to organizations providing humanitarian assistance in regions 
        affected by violence in August 2008;
Whereas the recognition by the Government of Russia of Abkhazia and South 
        Ossetia on August 26, 2008, was in violation of the sovereignty and 
        territorial integrity of Georgia;
Whereas Human Rights Watch concluded in its World Report 2011 that ``Russia 
        continued to occupy Georgia's breakaway regions of South Ossetia and 
        Abkhazia and strengthened its military presence in the region by 
        establishing a military base and placing an advanced surface-to-air 
        missile system in Abkhazia'';
Whereas the parties have taken some constructive steps in recent months, 
        including the resumption of direct flights between Russia and Georgia, 
        Russian troop withdrawal from the Georgian village of Perevi, and 
        regular participation in the Incident Prevention and Response Mechanism;
Whereas these positive steps neither adequately address the humanitarian 
        situation on the ground nor constitute full compliance with the terms of 
        the August 2008 ceasefire agreement;
Whereas, on November 23, 2010, before the European Parliament, Georgian 
        President Saakashvili declared that ``Georgia will never use force to 
        restore its territorial integrity and sovereignty'';
Whereas Secretary of State Clinton stated in Tbilisi on July 5, 2010, ``We 
        continue to call for Russia to abide by the August 2008 cease-fire 
        commitment . . . including ending the occupation and withdrawing Russian 
        troops from South Ossetia and Abkhazia to their pre-conflict 
        positions.'';
Whereas the Russian Federation blocked the extension of the Organization for 
        Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) Mission to Georgia and the 
        United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia, forcing the missions to 
        withdraw from South Ossetia and Abkhazia;
Whereas troops of the Russian Federation stationed in Abkhazia and South Ossetia 
        continue to be present without the consent of the Government of Georgia 
        or a mandate from the United Nations or other multilateral 
        organizations;
Whereas, at the April 15, 2011, meeting in Berlin between the foreign ministers 
        of Georgia and NATO, Secretary of State Clinton stated, ``U.S. support 
        for Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity remains steadfast. . 
        . . We share Georgian concerns regarding recent Russian activities that 
        can negatively affect regional stability.'';
Whereas, on April 25-26, 2011, Foreign Minister of Russia Sergei Lavrov made a 
        high-profile visit to Abkhazia and South Ossetia, which was immediately 
        criticized by the Department of State as ``inconsistent with the 
        principle of territorial integrity and Georgia's internationally 
        recognized borders'';
Whereas the Senate supports United States efforts to develop a productive 
        relationship with the Russian Federation in areas of mutual interest, 
        including non-proliferation and arms control, cooperation concerning the 
        failure of the Government of Iran to meet its international obligations 
        with regard to its nuclear programs, counter-terrorism, Afghanistan, 
        anti-piracy, and economics and trade; and
Whereas the Senate agrees that these efforts must not compromise longstanding 
        United States policy or United States support for its allies and 
        partners worldwide: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) affirms that it is the policy of the United States to 
        support the sovereignty, independence, and territorial 
        integrity of Georgia and the inviolability of its borders, and 
        to recognize Abkhazia and South Ossetia as regions of Georgia 
        occupied by the Russian Federation;
            (2) calls upon the Government of Russia to take steps to 
        fulfill all the terms and conditions of the 2008 ceasefire 
        agreements between Georgia and Russia, including returning 
        military forces to pre-war positions and ensuring access to 
        international humanitarian aid to all those affected by the 
        conflict;
            (3) urges the Government of Russia and the authorities in 
        control in the regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia to allow 
        for the full and dignified return of internally displaced 
        persons and international missions to the territories of 
        Abkhazia and South Ossetia;
            (4) supports peaceful, constructive engagement and 
        confidence-building measures between the Government of Georgia 
        and the authorities in control in South Ossetia and Abkhazia 
        and encourages additional people-to-people contacts; and
            (5) affirms that finding a peaceful resolution to the 
        conflict is a key priority for the United States in the 
        Caucasus region and that lasting regional stability can only be 
        achieved through peaceful means and long-term diplomatic and 
        political dialogue between all parties.
