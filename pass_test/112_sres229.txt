                               RESOLUTION


 
  Recognizing the heroic efforts of firefighters to contain numerous 
wildfires that have affected thousands of people throughout the United 
                                States.

Whereas every State in the United States has been affected by wildfire in 2011;
Whereas firefighters and residents have had to contend with extreme and erratic 
        fire behavior and rapid rates of fire spread;
Whereas, as of June 12, 2011, more than 32,189 wildfires have burned more than 
        4,700,000 acres of land, which represents more acres burned than in all 
        of 2010 and approximately 600,000 more acres than the 50-year average of 
        total acres burned in the United States in an entire year;
Whereas, as of June 12, 2011--

    (1) the Southwestern States have reported more than 1,600 fires that 
have burned more than 1,700,000 acres;

    (2) the Southern States have reported more than 27,000 fires that have 
burned more than 2,400,000 acres;

    (3) the Northern and Central Rocky Mountain States have reported 818 
fires that have burned more than 250,000 acres;

    (4) the State of California and Great Basin Region have reported more 
than 7,200 fires that have burned more than 21,000 acres;

    (5) the Northwestern States and Alaska have reported more than 400 
fires that have burned more than 260,000 acres; and

    (6) the Eastern States have reported more than 3,500 fires that have 
burned more than 41,000 acres;

Whereas, as of June 29, 2011, firefighters and personnel from the Federal, 
        State, and county levels have responded overwhelmingly to battle 
        wildfires throughout the United States, filling more than 95,600 
        requests for firefighter crew members; and
Whereas the brave men and women who answered the calls for assistance have 
        worked to minimize the displacement of thousands of residents and to 
        protect against loss of life and property: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes the heroic efforts of firefighters to 
        contain wildfires and protect lives, homes, natural resources, 
        and rural economies throughout the United States;
            (2) encourages the people and government officials of the 
        United States to express their appreciation to the brave men 
        and women serving in the firefighting services throughout the 
        United States;
            (3) encourages the people and communities of the United 
        States to be diligent in preventing and preparing for 
        wildfires; and
            (4) encourages the people of the United States to keep in 
        their thoughts those who have experienced loss as a result of 
        wildfire.
                                 <all>
