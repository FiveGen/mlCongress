Whereas Rice University is celebrating its 100th year as a renowned research 
        university advancing education in the arts, humanities, and sciences;
Whereas the William Marsh Rice Institute for the Advancement of Literature, 
        Science, and Art, named for its benefactor William Marsh Rice and now 
        known as Rice University, was inaugurated on October 12, 1912, in 
        Houston, Texas;
Whereas the first president of Rice University, Edgar Odell Lovett, set forth an 
        ambitious vision for a prestigious research university;
Whereas Rice University is a leading institution of higher education, ranked

        Report every year since the rankings began in 1983;

        affordable through generous financial aid programs and ranks among the 
        10 best value private colleges by Princeton Review;
Whereas Rice University plays a leading role in research in many fields, 
        including nanotechnology, space, cellular technology, bioinformatics, 
        energy, health, and the environment;
Whereas Rice University has invaluably contributed to space exploration, 
        becoming the first university in the United States to create a 
        department dedicated to space exploration and donating the land now home 
        to the Johnson Space Center of the National Aeronautics and Space 
        Administration;
Whereas the groundbreaking discovery of buckminsterfullerene, referred to as 
        ``buckyballs'', on the campus of Rice University in 1985 launched the 
        new field of fullerene chemistry, helped launch the new scientific field 
        of nanotechnology, earned two Rice University professors, Dr. Richard 
        Smalley and Dr. Robert Curl, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, and is now 
        leading to life-saving and life-enhancing breakthroughs in medicine, 
        transportation, energy, the environment, defense, and many other 
        endeavors;
Whereas Nobel Prize recipient Dr. Richard Smalley of Rice University played a 
        significant role in forming The Academy of Medicine, Engineering, and 
        Science of Texas, an organization for the Texas members of the National 
        Academies and the first organization in Texas dedicated to building 
        collaboration among Texas's most distinguished scientific, academic, and 
        corporate minds in research and public policy;
Whereas the goal of Rice University is to prepare its students to succeed in a 
        highly competitive and complex world, and many of its alumni have 
        distinguished themselves in their service and contributions to the 
        United States;
Whereas Rice University is one of three Texas universities to be chosen as a 
        member of the Association of American Universities, and the only private 
        university in Texas that is a member of that association;
Whereas Rice University is fortunate to have exceptionally fine trustees, 
        administrators, and faculty members who have placed emphasis on 
        inspiring students to succeed in the arts, humanities, and sciences;
Whereas the contributions of Rice University and its alumni have enriched the 
        history of the United States and the world in the arts, humanities, 
        sports, and sciences; and
Whereas the success of Rice University is the result of a united effort by many 
        resourceful and dedicated individuals, and all who are associated with 
        the preservation of the great traditions of Rice University deserve to 
        be proud of their accomplishments: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate recognizes the 100th anniversary of Rice 
University and expresses gratitude to the university for its 
innumerable contributions to higher education and the United States.
