  Honoring Senator Barbara Mikulski for becoming the longest-serving

Whereas the Honorable Barbara Mikulski has had a long and distinguished career 
        as a United States Senator from the State of Maryland;
Whereas Senator Mikulski was first elected to the United States Congress as a 
        member of the House of Representatives in 1976, where she served until 
        winning election to the Senate in 1986;
Whereas Senator Mikulski is the first woman to be elected to statewide office in 
        Maryland;
Whereas, in the 103rd Congress, Senator Mikulski was the first woman to be 
        elected Assistant Senate Democratic Floor Leader;
Whereas Senator Mikulski was the first woman in the Senate Democratic 
        Leadership, serving as Secretary of the Senate Democratic Conference in 
        the 104th through the 108th Congresses;
Whereas in 1997, Senator Mikulski became the most senior woman serving in the 
        Senate;
Whereas Senator Mikulski is the first woman to serve on the Appropriations 
        Committee of the Senate and the first woman to chair the Appropriations 
        Committee's Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related 
        Agencies;
Whereas Senator Mikulski has not only had a path breaking career, but has won 
        the admiration and respect of colleagues on both sides of the aisle for 
        her hard work, passionate and effective advocacy, commitment to social 
        and economic justice, and willingness to serve as a mentor and role 
        model to other senators; and
Whereas Senator Mikulski has now surpassed the record of former Senator Margaret 
        Chase Smith as the longest serving female Senator in the history of the 
        United States: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate recognizes and honors Senator Barbara 
Mikulski for becoming the longest-serving female Senator in history.
