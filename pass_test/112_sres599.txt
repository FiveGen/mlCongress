                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing vigorous support and unwavering commitment to the welfare, 
     security, and survival of the State of Israel as a Jewish and 
  democratic state with secure borders, and recognizing and strongly 
  supporting its right to act in self-defense to protect its citizens 
                       against acts of terrorism.

Whereas Hamas was founded with the stated goal of destroying the State of 
        Israel;
Whereas Hamas has been designated by the Secretary of State as a Foreign 
        Terrorist Organization;
Whereas Hamas refuses to recognize Israel's right to exist, renounce violence, 
        and accept previous agreements between Israel and the Palestinians;
Whereas Hamas has launched thousands of rockets and missiles since Israel 
        dismantled settlements and withdrew from Gaza in 2005;
Whereas terrorists in the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip have fired approximately 
        900 rockets and missile shells into Israel this year, an increase from 
        roughly 675 attacks in 2011 and 350 in 2010;
Whereas Hamas has increased the range of its rockets, reportedly with support 
        from Iran and others, putting additional large numbers of Israelis in 
        danger of rocket attacks from Gaza;
Whereas, on November 14, 2012, President Barack Obama condemned the rocket fire 
        from Gaza into Israel and reiterated Israel's right to self-defense; and
Whereas Israel, a fellow democracy, has an inherent right to self defense in the 
        face of terrorist attacks: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) expresses unwavering commitment to the security of the 
        State of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state with secure 
        borders, and recognizes and strongly supports its inherent 
        right to act in self-defense to protect its citizens against 
        acts of terrorism;
            (2) reiterates that Hamas must end Gaza-linked terrorist 
        rocket and missile attacks against Israel, recognize Israel's 
        right to exist, renounce violence, and agree to accept previous 
        agreements between Israel and the Palestinians;
            (3) urges the United Nations Security Council to condemn 
        the recent spike in Gaza-linked terrorist missile attacks 
        against Israel, which risk causing civilian casualties in both 
        Israel and Gaza; and
            (4) encourages the President to continue to work 
        diplomatically with the international community to prevent 
        Hamas and other Gaza-based terrorist organizations from 
        retaining or rebuilding the capability to launch rockets and 
        missiles against Israel.
                                 <all>
