        exploited through the website, nor the 3 women in Detroit who are dead 
        possibly because they were trafficked on the site. Revenue from the 
        exploitation and physical harm of women and minors is despicable.

        Until then, all the pressure that can be brought to bear must 
        continue.'';

        publication, take down the adult section of Backpage.com, before the 
        Village Voice must answer for yet another child who is abused and

        Eastern District of Missouri held that section 230 of the Communications 
        Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 230) (as added by section 509 of the 
        Communications Decency Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-104; 110 Stat. 137))

        victimization'' the teenage plaintiff suffered at the hands of the 
        criminal who posted on the website to perpetrate her vicious crimes; and
Whereas the Communications Decency Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-104; 110 Stat. 
        56) and the amendments made by that Act do not preclude a service 
        provider from voluntarily removing a portion of a website known to 
        facilitate the sexual exploitation of minors in order to protect 
        children in the United States: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) supports the efforts of law enforcement agencies to 
        provide training to law enforcement agents on how to identify 
        victims of sex trafficking, investigate cases of sex 
        trafficking, prosecute sex trafficking offenses, and rescue 
        victims of sex trafficking;

        the Federal Government, State and local governments, and non-
        profit and faith-based organizations, including medical, legal,

        ``adult entertainment'' section of the classified advertising 
        website Backpage.com to terminate the website's rampant 
        facilitation of online sex trafficking.
