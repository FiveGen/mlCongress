                               RESOLUTION


 
    Recognizing the accomplishments and commemorating the numerous 
  achievements and contributions of the Alaska Native people over the 
                             past 40 years.

Whereas on December 18, 1971, Public Law 92-203 (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) was 
        enacted to settle long-standing issues of Alaska Native aboriginal land 
        claims;
Whereas the pioneering work of Alaska Native leaders has created a lasting 
        legacy of professional and personal success;
Whereas Alaska Native people have prospered from their own initiative and 
        innovative approaches to fostering economic development through self-
        determination;
Whereas Alaska Natives have produced a significant number of educated Alaska 
        Natives who now serve in positions of leadership in the State of Alaska 
        and beyond;
Whereas Alaska Native people have risen to the challenge of independently and 
        productively managing their aboriginal land, which has fostered 
        sustainable businesses and created employment opportunities for the 
        people of the United States, both across the country and globally;
Whereas Alaska Native people continue to serve in positions of leadership in the 
        State of Alaska and beyond;
Whereas the dedication and enthusiasm of the next generation of Alaska Native 
        leaders honors the previous generation of Alaska Native leaders who 
        worked diligently to achieve the most significant Native land settlement 
        in the history of the United States;
Whereas the next generation of Alaska Native people will continue to make 
        positive changes in the world around them through acquired leadership 
        skills, cultural advocacy, and community engagement;
Whereas the people of the United States have reason to commemorate the economic 
        and political contributions of Alaska Native people; and
Whereas the people of the United States have reason to honor the tremendous 
        educational, social, political, economic, and cultural achievements of 
        the Alaska Native people over the past 40 years: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes December 18, 2011, as the 40th anniversary 
        of the original enactment of the Alaska Native Claims 
        Settlement Act (Public Law 92-203; 43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.);
            (2) recognizes the significant educational, economic, 
        political, and cultural contributions of the Alaska Native 
        people over the past 40 years; and
            (3) encourages the people of the United States to 
        participate in activities that show support for the success of 
        the Native people and tribes of the State of Alaska.
                                 <all>
