                               RESOLUTION


 
   Congratulating the Boston Bruins for winning the 2011 Stanley Cup 
                             Championship.

Whereas on Wednesday, June 15, 2011, the Boston Bruins, the oldest National 
        Hockey League (NHL) franchise in the United States, brought the Stanley 
        Cup back to Boston for the first time in 39 years;
Whereas to accomplish this feat, the Bruins defeated the Vancouver Canucks, the 
        team with the best record in the NHL during the regular season, in Game 
        7 of the Stanley Cup Finals;
Whereas the Bruins became the first team in NHL history to win 3 deciding Game 
        7's during a single playoff run and twice came back from 0-2 series 
        deficits;
Whereas Bruins goaltender Tim Thomas won the Conn Smythe trophy, which is 
        awarded to the player deemed most valuable to his team during the 
        Stanley Cup playoffs;
Whereas Tim Thomas shut out the Canucks in the deciding game of the Finals, and 
        allowed only 8 goals over the 7 game series;
Whereas Bruins rookie Brad Marchand scored 11 goals in the playoffs, setting a 
        team record for playoff goals by a rookie, and tying for the second-most 
        playoff goals by a rookie in NHL history;
Whereas Bruins right wing Mark Recchi hoisted his third Stanley Cup, and is 
        retiring as a champion after 1,652 NHL regular-season games and 190 
        playoff games;
Whereas Bruins captain Zdeno Chara, at 6 feet, 9 inches tall, lifted the Stanley 
        Cup as high above the ice as it has ever been lifted;
Whereas Bruins General Manager Peter Chiarelli made key trades near the trade 
        deadline to put the Bruins in a position for a Stanley Cup run, 
        acquiring Tomas Kaberle, Rich Peverley, and Chris Kelly; and
Whereas Bruins Head Coach Claude Julien ensured that the Bruins played and won 
        as a team: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) congratulates the Boston Bruins for winning the 2011 
        Stanley Cup Championship; and
            (2) respectfully requests the Secretary of the Senate to 
        transmit an enrolled copy of this resolution to--
                    (A) Head Coach Claude Julien;
                    (B) President and former Bruins All-Star Cam Neely; 
                and
                    (C) General Manager Peter Chiarelli.
                                 <all>
