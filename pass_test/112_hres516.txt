H. Res. 516

                In the House of Representatives, U. S.,

                                                      January 24, 2012.
Whereas the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 established the modern budgeting 
        process;
Whereas the President is required to submit a budget to Congress each year;
Whereas the last time the House of Representatives passed a budget was on April 
        15, 2011;
Whereas the last time the Senate passed a budget was on April 29, 2009; and
Whereas people in the United States must routinely set budgets for themselves, 
        their businesses, and their families: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives that the 
passage of a fiscal year 2013 Federal budget is of national importance.
            Attest:

                                                                          Clerk.
