        title with 94 wins;

        down three games to one to defeat the defending World Series champions, 
        the St. Louis Cardinals, for the National League championship;
Whereas the San Francisco Giants won 7 straight post-season games and allowed 
        just 7 runs in that span;
Whereas third baseman Pablo Sandoval received the World Series Most Valuable

        timely hitting;
Whereas the San Francisco Giants are superbly led by President and Chief 
        Executive Officer Larry Baer, General Manager Brian Sabean, and Manager

        such as Willie Mays, Willie McCovey, Orlando Cepeda, Juan Marichal,

        eventually took them to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 
        Cooperstown, New York; and
Whereas the San Francisco Giants inspired the city of San Francisco and all 
        Giants fans by showing unprecedented determination, resolve, and 
        teamwork in winning the 2012 World Series: Now, therefore, be it

Francisco Giants for winning the 2012 World Series.
