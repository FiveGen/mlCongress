                               RESOLUTION


 
       Supporting the goals and ideals of Red Ribbon Week, 2011.

Whereas the Red Ribbon Campaign was established to commemorate the service of 
        Enrique ``Kiki'' Camarena, a special agent of the Drug Enforcement 
        Administration for 11 years who was murdered in the line of duty in 1985 
        while engaged in the battle against illicit drugs;
Whereas the Red Ribbon Campaign was established by the National Family 
        Partnership to preserve the memory of Special Agent Camarena and further 
        the cause for which he gave his life;
Whereas the Red Ribbon Campaign has been nationally recognized since 1988 and is 
        now the oldest and largest drug prevention program in the United States, 
        reaching millions of young people each year during Red Ribbon Week;
Whereas the Drug Enforcement Administration, established in 1973, aggressively 
        targets organizations involved in the growing, manufacturing, and 
        distribution of controlled substances and has been a steadfast partner 
        in commemorating Red Ribbon Week;
Whereas the Governors and attorneys general of the States, the National Family 
        Partnership, Parent Teacher Associations, Boys and Girls Clubs of 
        America, PRIDE Youth Programs, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and 
        hundreds of other organizations throughout the United States annually 
        celebrate Red Ribbon Week during the period of October 23 through 
        October 31;
Whereas the objective of Red Ribbon Week is to promote the creation of drug-free 
        communities through drug prevention efforts, education, parental 
        involvement, and community-wide support;
Whereas drug abuse is one of the major challenges that the United States faces 
        in securing a safe and healthy future for families in the United States;
Whereas drug abuse and alcohol abuse contribute to domestic violence and sexual 
        assault and place the lives of children at risk;
Whereas, between 1998 and 2008, the percentages of admissions to substance abuse 
        treatment programs as a result of the abuse of marijuana and 
        methamphetamines rose significantly;
Whereas drug dealers specifically target children by marketing illicit drugs 
        that mimic the appearance and names of well-known brand-name candies and 
        foods;
Whereas emerging drug threats and growing epidemics demand attention, with 
        particular focus on the abuse of prescription medications, the second 
        most abused drug by young people in the United States;
Whereas since the majority of teenagers abusing prescription drugs get the 
        prescription drugs from family, friends, and home medicine cabinets, the 
        Drug Enforcement Administration will host a National Take Back Day on 
        October 29, 2011, for the public to safely dispose of unused or expired 
        prescription medications that can lead to accidental poisoning, 
        overdose, and abuse; and
Whereas parents, young people, schools, businesses, law enforcement agencies, 
        religious institutions, service organizations, senior citizens, medical 
        and military personnel, sports teams, and individuals throughout the 
        United States will demonstrate their commitment to healthy, productive, 
        and drug-free lifestyles by wearing and displaying red ribbons during 
        the week-long celebration of Red Ribbon Week: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of Red Ribbon Week, 2011;
            (2) encourages children and teens to choose to live drug-
        free lives; and
            (3) encourages the people of the United States--
                    (A) to promote the creation of drug-free 
                communities; and
                    (B) to participate in drug prevention activities to 
                show support for healthy, productive, and drug-free 
                lifestyles.
                                 <all>
