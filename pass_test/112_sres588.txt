                               RESOLUTION


 
Commending the 4 American public servants who died in Benghazi, Libya, 
United States Ambassador to Libya John Christopher Stevens, Sean Smith, 
Tyrone Woods, and Glen Doherty, for their tireless efforts on behalf of 
 the American people, and condemning the violent attack on the United 
                     States consulate in Benghazi.

Whereas on September 11, 2012, 4 American public servants, United States 
        Ambassador to Libya John Christopher Stevens, Sean Smith, Tyrone Woods, 
        and Glen Doherty, were killed in a reprehensible and vicious attack on 
        the United States consulate in Benghazi, Libya;
Whereas Ambassador Stevens--

    (1) was a courageous and exemplary representative of the United States;

    (2) had spent 21 years in the Foreign Service;

    (3) was deeply passionate about representing the United States through 
his diplomatic service; and

    (4) was an ardent friend of the Libyan people;

Whereas Ambassador Stevens served as Special Envoy to the Libyan Transitional 
        National Council in Benghazi during the 2011 Libyan revolution;
Whereas Ambassador Stevens was a dear friend of the Senate, having served on the 
        staff of the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate in 2006 and 
        2007 as a distinguished Pearson Fellow;
Whereas Foreign Service Information Management Officer Sean Smith--

    (1) was a husband and a father of 2 children;

    (2) joined the Department of State 10 years ago after serving in the 
United States Air Force; and

    (3) had served in the Foreign Service, before arriving in Benghazi, in 
Baghdad, Pretoria, Montreal, and The Hague;

Whereas Tyrone Woods was a husband and a father of three children, who, after 
        two decades of service as a Navy SEAL that included tours in Iraq and 
        Afghanistan, began working with the Department of State to protect 
        United States diplomatic personnel;
Whereas Glen Doherty, after 12 years of service as a Navy SEAL that included 
        tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, began working with the Department of 
        State to protect United States diplomatic personnel;
Whereas the 4 Americans who perished in the Benghazi attack made great 
        sacrifices and showed bravery in taking on a difficult post in Libya;
Whereas the violence in Benghazi coincided with an attack on the United States 
        Embassy in Cairo, Egypt, which was also swarmed by an angry mob of 
        protesters on September 11, 2012;
Whereas on a daily basis, United States diplomats, military personnel, and other 
        public servants risk their lives to serve the American people; and
Whereas throughout this Nation's history, thousands of Americans have sacrificed 
        their lives for the ideals of freedom, democracy, and partnership with 
        nations and people around the globe.
Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes the dedicated service and deep commitment of 
        Ambassador John Christopher Stevens, Sean Smith, Tyrone Woods, 
        and Glen Doherty in assisting the Libyan people as they 
        navigate the complex currents of democratic transition marked 
        in this case by profound instability;
            (2) praises Ambassador Stevens, who represented the highest 
        tradition of American public service, for his extraordinary 
        record of dedication to the United States' interests in some of 
        the most difficult and dangerous posts around the globe;
            (3) sends its deepest condolences to the families of those 
        American public servants killed in Benghazi;
            (4) commends the bravery of Foreign Service Officers, 
        United States Armed Forces, and public servants serving in 
        harm's way around the globe and recognizes the deep sacrifices 
        made by their families; and
            (5) condemns, in the strongest possible terms, the 
        despicable attacks on American diplomats and public servants in 
        Benghazi and calls for the perpetrators of such attacks to be 
        brought to justice.
