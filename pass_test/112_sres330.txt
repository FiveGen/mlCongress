                               RESOLUTION


 
  Designating January 27, 2012, as a national day of remembrance for 
  Americans who, during the Cold War, worked and lived downwind from 
  nuclear testing sites and were adversely affected by the radiation 
    exposure generated by the above ground nuclear weapons testing.

Whereas on January 27, 1951, the first of years of nuclear weapons tests was 
        conducted at a site known as the Nevada Proving Ground, located 
        approximately 65 miles northwest of Las Vegas, Nevada;
Whereas the extensive testing at the Nevada Proving Ground came just years after 
        the first ever nuclear weapon test, which was conducted on July 16, 
        1945, at what is known as the Trinity Atomic Test Site, located 
        approximately 35 miles south of Socorro, New Mexico;
Whereas many Americans who, during the Cold War, worked and lived downwind from 
        nuclear testing sites (referred to in this preamble as ``downwinders'') 
        were adversely affected by the radiation exposure generated by the above 
        ground nuclear weapons testing, and some of the downwinders sickened as 
        a result of the radiation exposure;
Whereas the downwinders paid a high price for the development of a nuclear 
        weapons program for the benefit of the United States; and
Whereas the downwinders deserve to be recognized for the sacrifice they have 
        made for the defense of the United States: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates January 27, 2012, as a national day of 
        remembrance for Americans who, during the Cold War, worked and 
        lived downwind from nuclear testing sites and were adversely 
        affected by the radiation exposure generated by the above 
        ground nuclear weapons testing; and
            (2) encourages the people of the United States to support 
        and participate in appropriate ceremonies, programs, and other 
        activities to commemorate January 27, 2012.
                                 <all>
