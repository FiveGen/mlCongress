        Revelations, on January 31, 1960, at the famed 92nd Street Y in New York 
        City;
Whereas Revelations is set to spirituals and draws inspiration from Ailey's 
        memories as a child growing up in Texas, and from the work of African-
        American writers such as James Baldwin and Langston Hughes;
Whereas since its premiere, Revelations has been seen by more than 23 million 
        theatergoers, in 71 countries, and on 6 continents, making it the most

        inaugurals of President Carter in 1977 and President Clinton in 1993;
Whereas Revelations captures the faith and perseverance of the African-American 
        people, and has influenced, and was influenced by, African-American 
        cultural heritage and the social fabric of the United States; and
Whereas Revelations is beloved by people around the world, and its universal 
        themes illustrate the strength and humanity within all of us: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate honors the Alvin Ailey American Dance 
Theater as it celebrates the 50th anniversary of the dance work
