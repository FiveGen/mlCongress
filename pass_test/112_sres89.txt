                               RESOLUTION


 
Relating to the death of Frank W. Buckles, the longest surviving United 
                 States veteran of the First World War.

Whereas Frank Woodruff Buckles is the last known American World War I veteran, 
        who passed away on February 27, 2011, at the age of 110, and represents 
        his generation of veterans;
Whereas America's support of Great Britain, France, Belgium, and its other 
        allies in World War I marked the first time in the Nation's history that 
        American soldiers went abroad in defense of liberty against foreign 
        aggression, and it marked the true beginning of the ``American 
        century'';
Whereas more than 4,000,000 men and women from the United States served in 
        uniform during World War I, among them 2 future presidents, Harry S. 
        Truman and Dwight D. Eisenhower;
Whereas 2,000,000 individuals from the United States served overseas during 
        World War I, including 200,000 naval personnel who served on the seas;
Whereas the United States suffered 375,000 casualties during World War I, 
        including 116,516 deaths;
Whereas the events of 1914 through 1918 shaped the world, the United States, and 
        the lives of millions of people in countless ways; and
Whereas Frank Woodruff Buckles is the last veteran to represent the 
        extraordinary legacy of the World War I veterans: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That--
            (1) the Senate recognizes the historic contributions of all 
        United States veterans who served in the First World War; and
            (2) when the Senate adjourns today, it stand adjourned as a 
        further mark of respect to the memory of Frank W. Buckles, the 
        longest surviving United States veteran of the First World War.
    Sec. 2.  The Secretary of the Senate is directed to transmit an 
enrolled copy of this resolution to the family of the deceased.
                                 <all>
