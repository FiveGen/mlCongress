                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing support for the designation of January 28, 2011 as National 
                           Data Privacy Day.

    Whereas the protection of the privacy of personal information is a 
            global imperative for governments, commerce, civil society, 
            and individuals;
    Whereas new and innovative technologies enhance our lives by 
            increasing our abilities to communicate, learn, share, and 
            produce, and every effort should be made to continue both 
            the development and the widespread use of such 
            technologies;
    Whereas the use of numerous technologies in our everyday lives and 
            in our work gives rise to the potential compromise of 
            personal data privacy if appropriate care is not taken, by 
            individuals, government, and businesses, to protect 
            personal information;
    Whereas many individuals are unaware of the risks to privacy posed 
            by new technologies, of data protection and privacy laws 
            generally, and of specific steps that they can take to help 
            protect the privacy of personal information;
    Whereas a continuing examination and understanding of the ways in 
            which personal information is collected, used, stored, 
            shared and managed in an increasingly networked world will 
            contribute to the protection of personal privacy;
    Whereas National Data Privacy Day constitutes an international 
            collaboration and a nationwide and statewide effort to 
            raise awareness about data privacy and promote education 
            about the protection of personal information;
    Whereas government officials from the United States, Canada, and 
            Europe, privacy professionals, academic communities, legal 
            scholars, representatives of businesses and nonprofit 
            organizations, and others with an interest in data privacy 
            issues are working together on this date to further the 
            discussion about data privacy and protection;
    Whereas privacy and security professionals and educators are being 
            encouraged to take the time to discuss data privacy and 
            security issues with teens and young adults in schools and 
            Universities across the country, and parents are being 
            encouraged to discuss data privacy issues with their 
            children;
    Whereas the Federal Government has a demonstrated interest in 
            promoting privacy and security education in schools;
    Whereas the third annual Congressional recognition of National Data 
            Privacy Day will encourage more people nationwide to be 
            aware of data privacy concerns and to take steps to protect 
            their personal information; and
    Whereas January 28, 2011, would be an appropriate day to designate 
            as National Data Privacy Day: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) supports the designation of a National Data Privacy 
        Day;
            (2) encourages State and local governments to observe the 
        day with appropriate activities that promote awareness of data 
        privacy;
            (3) encourages educators and privacy professionals to 
        discuss data privacy and security issues with teens in high 
        schools across the United States;
            (4) encourages corporations to take steps to protect the 
        privacy and security of the personal information of their 
        clients and consumers; to design privacy into products they 
        create where possible; and to promote trust in technologies; 
        and
            (5) encourages individuals across the Nation to be aware of 
        data privacy concerns and to take steps to protect their 
        personal information.
                                 <all>
