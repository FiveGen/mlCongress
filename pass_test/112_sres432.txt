                               RESOLUTION


 
 Designating April 30, 2012, as ``Dia de los Ninos: Celebrating Young 
                              Americans''.

Whereas many nations throughout the world, and especially within the Western 
        hemisphere, celebrate ``Dia de los Ninos'', or ``Day of the Children'', 
        on the 30th of April, in recognition and celebration of their country's 
        future--their children;
Whereas children represent the hopes and dreams of the people of the United 
        States and children are the center of families in the United States;
Whereas the people of the United States should nurture and invest in children to 
        preserve and enhance economic prosperity, democracy, and the American 
        spirit;
Whereas according to the 2010 Census report, there are more than 50,000,000 
        individuals of Hispanic descent living in the United States, more than 
        17,000,000 of those are children;
Whereas Hispanics in the United States, the youngest and fastest growing ethnic 
        community in the Nation, continue the tradition of honoring their 
        children on Dia de los Ninos, and wish to share this custom with the 
        rest of the Nation;
Whereas the primary teachers of family values, morality, and culture are parents 
        and family members, and we rely on children to pass on family values, 
        morals, and culture to future generations;
Whereas the importance of literacy and education are most often communicated to 
        children through family members;
Whereas families should be encouraged to engage in family and community 
        activities that include extended and elderly family members, and that 
        encourage children to explore and develop confidence;
Whereas the designation of a day to honor the children of the United States will 
        help affirm for the people of the United States the significance of 
        family, education, and community;
Whereas the designation of a day of special recognition for the children of the 
        United States will provide an opportunity for children to reflect on 
        their future, to articulate their aspirations, and to find comfort and 
        security in the support of their family members and communities;
Whereas the National Latino Children's Institute, serving as a voice for 
        children, has worked with cities throughout the Nation to declare April 
        30, 2012, to be ``Dia de los Ninos: Celebrating Young Americans'', a day 
        to bring together Hispanics and other communities nationwide to 
        celebrate and uplift children; and
Whereas the children of a nation are the responsibility of all of its people, 
        and people should be encouraged to celebrate the gifts of children to 
        society: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates April 30, 2012, as ``Dia de los Ninos: 
        Celebrating Young Americans''; and
            (2) calls on the people of the United States to join with 
        all children, families, organizations, communities, churches, 
        cities, and States across the Nation to observe the day with 
        appropriate ceremonies, including activities that--
                    (A) center around children, and are free or minimal 
                in cost so as to encourage and facilitate the 
                participation of all people;
                    (B) are positive and uplifting, and help children 
                express their hopes and dreams;
                    (C) provide opportunities for children of all 
                backgrounds to learn about one another's cultures and 
                to share ideas;
                    (D) include all members of the family, especially 
                extended and elderly family members, so as to promote 
                greater communication among the generations within a 
                family, enabling children to appreciate and benefit 
                from the experiences and wisdom of their elderly family 
                members;
                    (E) provide opportunities for families within a 
                community to get acquainted; and
                    (F) provide children with the support they need to 
                develop skills and confidence, and to find the inner 
                strength and the will and fire of the human spirit to 
                make their dreams come true.
                                 <all>
