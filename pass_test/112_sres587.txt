                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

           September 22 (legislative day, September 21), 2012

Mrs. Boxer (for herself, Ms. Collins, and Mr. Whitehouse) submitted the 
        following resolution; which was considered and agreed to

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
    Supporting ``Lights On Afterschool'', a national celebration of 
                         afterschool programs.

Whereas high-quality afterschool programs provide safe, challenging, engaging, 
        and fun learning experiences that help children and youth develop 
        social, emotional, physical, cultural, and academic skills;
Whereas high-quality afterschool programs support working families by ensuring 
        that the children in those families are safe and productive after the 
        regular school day ends;
Whereas high-quality afterschool programs build stronger communities by 
        involving students, parents, business leaders, and adult volunteers in 
        the lives of children in the United States, thereby promoting positive 
        relationships among children, youth, families, and adults;
Whereas high-quality afterschool programs engage families, schools, and diverse 
        community partners in advancing the well-being of children in the United 
        States;
Whereas ``Lights On Afterschool'', a national celebration of afterschool 
        programs held on October 18, 2012, highlights the critical importance of 
        high-quality afterschool programs in the lives of children, their 
        families, and their communities;
Whereas more than 28,000,000 children in the United States have parents who work 
        outside the home and approximately 15,100,000 children in the United 
        States have no place to go after school; and
Whereas nearly 2 in 5 afterschool programs report that their budgets are in 
        worse condition today than at the height of the recession in 2008, and 
        more than 3 in 5 afterschool programs report that their level of funding 
        is lower than it was 3 years ago, making it difficult for afterschool 
        programs across the United States to keep their doors open and their 
        lights on: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate supports ``Lights On Afterschool'', a 
national celebration of afterschool programs held on October 18, 2012.
                                 <all>
