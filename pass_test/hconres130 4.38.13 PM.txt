                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION

Whereas on July 7, a large and violent confrontation occurred in Kenya when 
        police stormed Nairobi's All-Saints Cathedral and attacked those present 
        at a prayer meeting;
Whereas prodemocracy activists throughout Kenya have demonstrated in favor of 
        reform of Kenya's constitution and the repeal of repressive colonial 
        laws;
Whereas the bloody suppression of the constitutional reform rallies, the 
        disruptive behavior of some demonstrators, and the recent ethnic 
        confrontations in Kenya's Coast Province have jeopardized both the 
        safety and the political rights of average Kenyans;
Whereas the Government of Kenya has continued to disrupt opposition rallies and 
        meetings even after pledging to take a more tolerant approach to them in 
        late July;
Whereas these events led to the consideration in early September of a package of 
        democratic reforms by members of parliament representing the government 
        and the opposition, but not including representatives of Kenyan civil 
        society;
Whereas it remains unclear whether long-discussed political reforms can be 
        effectively implemented in the time remaining before anticipated 
        elections in 1997; and
Whereas colonial laws have given Kenyan President Daniel Arap Moi sweeping 
        powers to suppress political opponents and thwart reform throughout his 
        19-year rule: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That the Congress--
            (1) recognizes and commends those Kenyans who have 
        demonstrated their love of peace, law, and order;
            (2) condemns those who are inciting others to violence, 
        looting, and destroying property;
            (3) urges an immediate cessation to the violence in Kenya;
            (4) urges the Government of Kenya to take all necessary and 
        lawful steps to avoid more violence in the future;
            (5) recognizes President Moi's response to domestic and 
        international pressure to allow meaningful constitutional and 
        legal electoral process reform through the current package of 
        legislation agreed to by the ruling party and opposition party 
        representatives;
            (6) calls for the prodemocracy movement to remain unified 
        in working toward implementing constitutional, statutory, and 
        administrative reforms;
            (7) urges rapid progress toward conducting free and fair 
        elections; and
            (8) urges the United States Government and the 
        international community to continue to work with all parties to 
        encourage the Government of Kenya to ensure a lasting and 
        committed transition to democracy, including an immediate 
        review of the propriety of the time of the next elections.

            Passed the House of Representatives November 13, 1997.

            Attest:

                                                                 Clerk.
