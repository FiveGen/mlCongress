    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives that the 
Secretary of State, in all official contacts with Turkish leaders and other 
Turkish officials, should emphasize that Turkey should--
            (1) end all forms of religious discrimination;
            (2) allow the rightful church and lay owners of Christian church 
        properties, without hindrance or restriction, to organize and administer 
        prayer services, religious education, clerical training, appointments, 
        and succession, religious community gatherings, social services, 
        including ministry to the needs of the poor and infirm, and other 
        religious activities;
            (3) return to their rightful owners all Christian churches and other 
        places of worship, monasteries, schools, hospitals, monuments, relics, 
        holy sites, and other religious properties, including movable 
        properties, such as artwork, manuscripts, vestments, vessels, and other 
        artifacts; and
            (4) allow the rightful Christian church and lay owners of Christian 
        church properties, without hindrance or restriction, to preserve, 
        reconstruct, and repair, as they see fit, all Christian churches and 
        other places of worship, monasteries, schools, hospitals, monuments, 
        relics, holy sites, and other religious properties within Turkey.
            Attest:

                                                                          Clerk.
