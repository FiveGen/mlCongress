SEC. 3. REVIEW BY THE UNITED STATES SENTENCING COMMISSION.
    (a) In General.--Pursuant to its authority under section 994(p) of 
title 28, United States Code, the United States Sentencing Commission 
shall review and, if appropriate, amend the Federal sentencing 
guidelines and policy statements applicable to persons convicted of 
offenses relating to the transmission or attempted transmission of a 
stolen trade secret outside of the United States or economic espionage, 
in order to reflect the intent of Congress that penalties for such 
offenses under the Federal sentencing guidelines and policy statements 
appropriately, reflect the seriousness of these offenses, account for 
the potential and actual harm caused by these offenses, and provide 
adequate deterrence against such offenses.
    (b) Requirements.--In carrying out this section, the United States 
Sentencing Commission shall--
        (1) consider the extent to which the Federal sentencing 
    guidelines and policy statements appropriately account for the 
    simple misappropriation of a trade secret, including the 
    sufficiency of the existing enhancement for these offenses to 
    address the seriousness of this conduct;
        (2) consider whether additional enhancements in the Federal 
    sentencing guidelines and policy statements are appropriate to 
    account for--
            (A) the transmission or attempted transmission of a stolen 
        trade secret outside of the United States; and
            (B) the transmission or attempted transmission of a stolen 
        trade secret outside of the United States that is committed or 
        attempted to be committed for the benefit of a foreign 
        government, foreign instrumentality, or foreign agent;
        (3) ensure the Federal sentencing guidelines and policy 
    statements reflect the seriousness of these offenses and the need 
    to deter such conduct;
        (4) ensure reasonable consistency with other relevant 
    directives, Federal sentencing guidelines and policy statements, 
    and related Federal statutes;
        (5) make any necessary conforming changes to the Federal 
    sentencing guidelines and policy statements; and
        (6) ensure that the Federal sentencing guidelines adequately 
    meet the purposes of sentencing as set forth in section 3553(a)(2) 
    of title 18, United States Code.
    (c) Consultation.--In carrying out the review required under this 
section, the Commission shall consult with individuals or groups 
representing law enforcement, owners of trade secrets, victims of 
economic espionage offenses, the United States Department of Justice, 
the United States Department of Homeland Security, the United States 
Department of State and the Office of the United States Trade 
Representative.
    (d) Review.--Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of 
this Act, the Commission shall complete its consideration and review 
under this section.
