                               RESOLUTION


 
           Honoring the bicentennial of the City of Astoria.

Whereas Astoria is a scenic gem on the coast of Oregon, and the residents of 
        Astoria have long represented the essence of what it means to be an 
        Oregonian;
Whereas the site of Astoria, located at the mouth of the Columbia River where 
        the Columbia River meets the Pacific Ocean, marks the endpoint of the 
        epic Lewis and Clark expedition to explore the American West, and was 
        founded by fur traders in 1811;
Whereas Thomas Jefferson recognized Astoria as the Nation's first significant 
        claim to the West and noted that were it not for the settlement of 
        Astoria, the United States may have ended at the Rocky Mountains;
Whereas Astoria evolved from being a fur trading hub to serving as the ad-hoc 
        capital of Oregon Country, and later became a prominent leader in the 
        fishing and timber industries and an important port city;
Whereas Astoria was incorporated in 1856, and today is a center for 
        manufacturing, art, tourism, and fishing;
Whereas settlers from Scandinavia and China were among the first to come to 
        Astoria, and the presence of their descendants has contributed to a town 
        rich in both history and culture;
Whereas Astoria is a vibrant tourism destination that has chronicled its 
        remarkable history with the establishment of superb museums and well-
        preserved historical sites;
Whereas citizens of Astoria and visitors from around the country and the world 
        enjoy boating, fishing, and hiking in one of the most beautiful areas on 
        the West Coast; and
Whereas the natural beauty of the region has been noted by many artists, 
        filmmakers, and writers, serving as the backdrop for many stories, 
        including the beloved film ``The Goonies'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) Astoria's bicentennial should be observed and 
        celebrated;
            (2) the people of Astoria should be thanked for their many 
        pioneering contributions to the State of Oregon and the United 
        States; and
            (3) an enrolled copy of this resolution should be 
        transmitted to the State of Oregon for appropriate display.
                                 <all>
