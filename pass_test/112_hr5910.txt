To direct the Secretary of Commerce, in coordination with the heads of 
other relevant Federal departments and agencies, to produce a report on 
   enhancing the competitiveness of the United States in attracting 
           foreign direct investment, and for other purposes.

United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Global Investment in American Jobs 
Act of 2012''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) It remains an urgent national priority to improve 
        economic growth and create new jobs.
            (2) National security requires economic strength and global 
        engagement.
            (3) Businesses today have a wide array of choices when 
        considering where to invest, expand, or establish new 
        operations.
            (4) Administrations of both parties have consistently 
        reaffirmed the need to maintain an open investment climate as a 
        key to domestic economic prosperity and security.
            (5) The United States has historically been the largest 
        worldwide recipient of global investment but has seen its share 
        of inbound global investment decline relative to its gross 
        domestic product in recent years.
            (6) Governors and mayors throughout the United States face 
        increasing competition from other countries as they work to 
        recruit investment from global companies.
            (7) Foreign direct investment can benefit the economy and 
        workforce of every State and Commonwealth in the United States.
            (8) According to the latest Federal statistics, the United 
        States subsidiaries of companies headquartered abroad 
        contribute to the United States economy in a variety of 
        important ways, including by--
                    (A) providing jobs for nearly 5,300,000 Americans 
                with average compensation that is approximately 33 
                percent higher than the national private-sector 
                average, as these jobs are often in high-skilled, high-
                paying industries;
                    (B) strengthening the United States industrial base 
                and employing nearly 15 percent of the United States 
                manufacturing sector workforce;
                    (C) establishing operations in the United States 
                from which to sell goods and services around the world, 
                thereby producing nearly 18 percent of United States 
                exports;
                    (D) promoting innovation with more than 
                $41,000,000,000 in annual United States research and 
                development activities;
                    (E) paying nearly 17 percent of United States 
                corporate income taxes; and
                    (F) purchasing more than $1,800,000,000,000 in 
                domestic goods and services annually from local 
                suppliers and small businesses, amounting to 80 cents 
                for every dollar spent on input purchases.
            (9) These companies account for 5.8 percent of United 
        States private sector Gross Domestic Product.
            (10) The Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of State 
        have declared increasing inbound global investment to be among 
        their top priorities.
            (11) The President issued a statement in 2011 reaffirming 
        the longstanding open investment policy of the United States 
        and encouraged all countries to pursue such a policy.
            (12) The President signed an Executive order in 2011 to 
        establish the SelectUSA initiative, aimed at promoting greater 
        levels of business investment in the United States.
            (13) The President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness in 
        2011 recommended the establishment of a National Investment 
        Initiative to attract $1,000,000,000,000 in new business 
        investment from abroad.
            (14) The United States and the European Union recently 
        unveiled a set of principles aimed at promoting a more open 
        climate for international investment and intended as a model 
        for countries around the world.
            (15) Maintaining the United States commitment to open 
        investment policy encourages other countries to do the same and 
        enables the United States to open new markets abroad for United 
        States companies and their products.

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the ability of the United States to attract inbound 
        investment, particularly net new investment, is directly linked 
        to the long-term economic prosperity, competitiveness, and 
        security of the United States;
            (2) in order to remain the most attractive location for 
        global investment, Congress and Federal departments and 
        agencies should be mindful of the potential impact upon the 
        ability of the United States to attract foreign direct 
        investment when evaluating proposed legislation or regulatory 
        policy;
            (3) it is a top national priority to enhance the 
        competitiveness, prosperity, and security of the United States 
        by--
                    (A) removing unnecessary barriers to inward global 
                investment and the jobs that it creates throughout the 
                United States; and
                    (B) promoting policies to ensure the United States 
                remains the premier destination for global companies to 
                invest, hire, innovate, and manufacture their products; 
                and
            (4) while foreign direct investment can enhance our 
        economic strength, policies regarding foreign direct investment 
        should reflect national security interests.

              FINANCIAL DATA IMPROVEMENTS ACT OF 1990.
