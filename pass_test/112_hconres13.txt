                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                            November 2, 2011

        Received and referred to the Committee on the Judiciary

                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
  Reaffirming ``In God We Trust'' as the official motto of the United 
    States and supporting and encouraging the public display of the 
   national motto in all public buildings, public schools, and other 
                        government institutions.

Whereas ``In God We Trust'' is the official motto of the United States;
Whereas the sentiment, ``In God We Trust'', has been an integral part of United 
        States society since its founding;
Whereas in times of national challenge or tragedy, the people of the United 
        States have turned to God as

              

 their source for sustenance, protection, wisdom, strength, and direction;

Whereas the Declaration of Independence recognizes God, our Creator, as the 
        source of our rights, ``We hold these truths to be self-evident, that 
        all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with 
        certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the 
        pursuit of happiness.'';
Whereas the national anthem of the United States says ``praise the power that 
        hath made and preserved us a nation * * * and this be our motto: in God 
        is our trust.'';
Whereas the words ``In God We Trust'' appear over the entrance to the Senate 
        Chamber and above the Speaker's rostrum in the House Chamber;
Whereas the oath taken by all Federal employees, except the President, states 
        ``I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which 
        I am about to enter. So help me God.'';
Whereas John Adams said, ``Statesmen may plan and speculate for Liberty, but it 
        is Religion and Morality alone, which can establish the Principles upon 
        which Freedom can securely stand.'';
Whereas if religion and morality are taken out of the marketplace of ideas, the 
        very freedom on which the United States was founded cannot be secured;
Whereas as President Eisenhower said and President Ford later repeated, 
        ``Without God, there could be no American form of government, nor, an 
        American way of life.''; and
Whereas President John F. Kennedy said, ``The guiding principle and prayer of 
        this Nation has been, is now, and ever shall be `In God We Trust.''': 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That Congress reaffirms ``In God We Trust'' as the official motto of 
the United States and supports and encourages the public display of the 
national motto in all public buildings, public schools, and other 
government institutions.

            Passed the House of Representatives November 1, 2011.

            Attest:

                                                 KAREN L. HAAS,

                                                                 Clerk.
