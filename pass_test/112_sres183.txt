                               RESOLUTION


 
    Designating May 14, 2011, as ``National Police Survivors Day''.

Whereas the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in Judiciary Square in 
        Washington, D.C. lists on a Wall of Remembrance the names of more than 
        19,000 law enforcement officers who have died in the line of duty;
Whereas in the United States, 1 law enforcement officer is killed every 53 
        hours;
Whereas in 2010, 152 law enforcement officers lost their lives in the line of 
        duty;
Whereas on May 14, 1983, on the eve of the 2nd annual National Peace Officers' 
        Memorial Service, 10 widows of fallen law enforcement officers came 
        together to discuss the lack of support for law enforcement survivors;
Whereas 1 year later, that discussion led to the formation of Concerns of Police 
        Survivors, Inc. at the 1st annual National Police Survivors' Seminar, 
        which drew 110 law enforcement survivors from throughout the United 
        States;
Whereas Concerns of Police Survivors, Inc. has grown to serve more than 15,000 
        surviving families of fallen law enforcement officers by providing 
        healing, love, and the opportunity for a renewed life;
Whereas Concerns of Police Survivors, Inc. and its 52 chapters throughout the 
        United States provide a program of peer support and counseling to law 
        enforcement survivors, help survivors obtain the death benefits to which 
        they are entitled, and sponsor scholarships to enable children and 
        surviving spouses to pursue postsecondary education;
Whereas Concerns of Police Survivors, Inc. sponsors a year-round series of 
        seminars, meetings, and youth activities, including the National Police 
        Survivors' Seminar during National Police Week, retreats for parents, 
        spouses, and siblings, and programs and summer activities for children;
Whereas Concerns of Police Survivors, Inc. helps law enforcement agencies cope 
        with the loss of an officer by promoting the adoption of standardized 
        policies and procedures for line-of-duty deaths; and
Whereas Concerns of Police Survivors, Inc. inspires the public to recognize the 
        sacrifices made by law enforcement families by encouraging all citizens 
        of the United States to tie a blue ribbon to their car antenna during 
        National Police Week: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates May 14, 2011, as ``National Police Survivors 
        Day''; and
            (2) calls on the people of the United States to observe 
        ``National Police Survivors Day'' with appropriate ceremonies 
        to pay respect to--
                    (A) the survivors of the fallen heroes of law 
                enforcement; and
                    (B) the fallen law enforcement officers who, 
                through their courageous deeds, have made the ultimate 
                sacrifice in service to the community.
                                 <all>
