                               RESOLUTION


 
     Designating September 2012 as ``National Preparedness Month''.

Whereas a terrorist attack, natural disaster, or other emergency could strike 
        any part of the United States at any time;
Whereas natural and manmade emergencies disrupt hundreds of thousands of lives 
        each year, costing lives and causing serious injuries and billions of 
        dollars in property damage;
Whereas Federal, State, and local officials, as well as private and nonprofit 
        organizations, are working to mitigate against, prevent, and respond to 
        all types of emergencies;
Whereas the people of the United States can help promote the overall emergency 
        preparedness of the United States by being prepared for all types of 
        emergencies;
Whereas National Preparedness Month provides an opportunity to highlight the 
        importance of public emergency preparedness and to encourage the people 
        of the United States to take steps to be better prepared for emergencies 
        at home, work, and school;
Whereas the people of the United States can prepare for emergencies by taking 
        steps, such as assembling emergency supply kits, creating family 
        emergency plans, staying informed about possible emergencies, and 
        obtaining reasonable levels of insurance; and
Whereas additional information about public emergency preparedness may be 
        obtained through the Ready Campaign of the Department of Homeland 
        Security at www.ready.gov or the American Red Cross at www.redcross.org/
        prepare: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates September 2012 as ``National Preparedness 
        Month''; and
            (2) encourages the Federal Government, States, localities, 
        schools, nonprofit organizations, businesses, and other 
        applicable entities, along with the people of the United 
        States, to observe National Preparedness Month with appropriate 
        events and activities to promote emergency preparedness.
                                 <all>
