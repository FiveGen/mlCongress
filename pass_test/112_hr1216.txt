            ``(2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to an abortion--

                physical disorder, physical injury, or physical 
                illness, that would, as certified by a physician, place 
                the woman in danger of death unless an abortion is 
                performed including a life endangering physical 
                condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy 
                itself.
            ``(3) None of the funds made available pursuant to 
        subsection (g) may be provided to a qualified teaching health

        health care entity does not provide, pay for, provide coverage 
        of, or refer for abortions.
            ``(4) In this subsection, the term `health care entity' 
        includes an individual physician or other health care 
        professional, a hospital, a provider-sponsored organization, a 
        health maintenance organization, a health insurance plan, or 
        any other kind of health care facility, organization, or 
        plan.''.
