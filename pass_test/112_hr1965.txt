        the Division of Corporation Finance of the Commission shall 
        jointly conduct a study, including a cost-benefit analysis, of 
        shareholder registration thresholds.
            (2) Costs and benefits.--The cost-benefit analysis under 
        paragraph (1) shall take into account--
                    (A) the incremental costs and benefits to investors 
                of the increased disclosure that results from 
                registration;
                    (B) the incremental costs and benefits to issuers 
                associated with registration and reporting 
                requirements; and
                    (C) the incremental administrative costs to the 
                Commission associated with different thresholds.
            (3) Thresholds.--The cost-benefit analysis under paragraph 
        (1) shall evaluate whether it is advisable to--
                    (A) increase the asset threshold;
                    (B) index the asset threshold to a measure of 
                inflation;
                    (C) increase the shareholder threshold;
                    (D) change the shareholder threshold to be based on 
                the number of beneficial owners; and
                    (E) create new thresholds based on other criteria.
    (b) Report.--Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of 
this Act, the Chief Economist and the Director of the Division of 
Corporation Finance of the Commission shall jointly submit to the 
Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the

report that includes--
            (1) the findings of the study required under subsection
