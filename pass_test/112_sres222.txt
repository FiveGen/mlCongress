                               RESOLUTION


 
Recognizing the American Revolution Center for its role in telling the 
story of the American Revolution and the continuing impact on struggles 
for freedom, self-government, and the rule of law throughout the world, 
and encouraging the Center in its efforts to build a new Museum of the 
                          American Revolution.

Whereas the American Revolution secured the independence of the United States of 
        America, and made possible a vibrant system of self-government based on 
        liberty and equality;
Whereas the history and ideas of the American Revolution have sustained the 
        Nation through its moments of greatest peril and inspired many of the 
        greatest achievements;
Whereas the American Revolution Center (in this resolution referred to as the 
        ``Center'') is the steward of a nationally significant collection of 
        artifacts, manuscripts, and artwork from the period of the American 
        Revolution;
Whereas the Center is actively working to be a ``connector'' to other American 
        Revolution organizations and sites through its website and with 
        collaborative programming;
Whereas the Center has committed itself to the establishment of a new ``Museum 
        of the American Revolution'' that is to be built in Philadelphia, 
        Pennsylvania, just steps from Independence Hall, the Liberty Bell, 
        Carpenter's Hall, and Christ Church;
Whereas the Museum of the American Revolution will be built in one of our 
        Nation's most historic neighborhoods, visited by many millions of people 
        from around the world each year;
Whereas the Museum of the American Revolution will tell the entire story of the 
        American Revolution, providing a context for heritage tourists as they 
        travel to other Revolutionary-era sites in Philadelphia and throughout 
        the United States; and
Whereas the Center and the proposed Museum of the American Revolution will 
        provide future generations with both a physical and a virtual venue to 
        learn the story of the American Revolution: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes the contribution of the American Revolution 
        Center to the preservation of the story of the founding of the 
        United States; and
            (2) expresses support for the Center's efforts to establish 
        an appropriate museum to tell such story to future generations.
                                 <all>
