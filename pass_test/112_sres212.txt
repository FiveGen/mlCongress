Congratulating the people and Government of the Republic of Slovenia on 
        the twentieth anniversary of the country's independence.

Whereas, on December 23, 1990, the people of Slovenia voted overwhelmingly in 
        favor of independence from the former Yugoslavia in a national 
        referendum;
Whereas, on June 25, 1991, the Republic of Slovenia declared itself as an 
        independent and sovereign nation;
Whereas, on December 23, 1991, the parliament of Slovenia adopted a constitution 
        based on the rule of law, respect for human rights, and democratic 
        ideals;
Whereas, during its 20 years of independence, Slovenia has been an important 
        United States ally in Central Europe and a strong advocate of democracy, 
        the rule of law, and the merits of an open, free market economy;
Whereas the Government of Slovenia has made important contributions to 
        international efforts to promote peace, stability, and development in 
        Southeast Europe, Afghanistan, and elsewhere;
Whereas the Government of Slovenia serves as a leader in efforts to remove 
        destructive land mines in parts of Southeast Europe and in other parts 
        of the world;
Whereas Slovenia has become an active member of international organizations, 
        including the United Nations, the Organization for Security and 
        Cooperation in Europe, the Council of Europe, the World Trade 
        Organization, the European Union, the North Atlantic Treaty 
        Organization, and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
        Development; and
Whereas Slovenia has further consolidated its international role through 
        successful chairmanship of the Organization for Security and Cooperation 
        in Europe in 2005, and, as the first new member from Central and Eastern 
        Europe, the presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2008: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate hereby--
            (1) congratulates the people and the Government of the 
        Republic of Slovenia as the country celebrates 20 years of 
        independence on June 25, 2011;
            (2) commends the people of Slovenia on the significant 
        progress made in the last 20 years;
            (3) recognizes the important role of the Slovenian 
        community in the United States to promote partnership and 
        cooperation between the two countries; and
            (4) encourages the Government of the Republic of Slovenia 
        to continue its important work in the transatlantic alliance, 
        and the efforts to further peace, stability, and prosperity in 
        Southeast Europe and elsewhere.
