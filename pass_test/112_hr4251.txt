determine whether allowing non-asset based third party logistics 
providers that arrange international transportation of freight to 
participate in the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism program,

circumstances, as determined by the Secretary, requiring more than one 
such in-person visit.

SEC. 207. SECURING THE TRANSPORTATION WORKER IDENTIFICATION CREDENTIAL 
              AGAINST USE BY UNAUTHORIZED ALIENS.

    (a) Process.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of 
        enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall establish a process 
        to ensure, to the maximum extent practicable, that an 
        individual who is not lawfully present in the United States 
        cannot obtain or continue to use a Transportation Worker 
        Identification Credential (in this section referred to as the 
        ``TWIC'').
            (2) Components.--In establishing the process under 
        subsection (a), the Secretary shall--
                    (A) publish a list of documents that will identify 
                non-United States citizen TWIC applicants and verify 
                their immigration statuses by requiring each such 
                applicants to produce a document or documents that 
                demonstrate--
                            (i) identity; and
                            (ii) proof of lawful presence in the United 
                        States; and
                    (B) establish training requirements to ensure that 
                trusted agents at TWIC enrollment centers receive 
                training to identify fraudulent documents.
    (b) Expiration of TWICs.--A TWIC expires on the date of its 
expiration, or in the date on which the individual to whom such a TWIC 
is issued is no longer lawfully present in the United States, whichever 
is earlier.
