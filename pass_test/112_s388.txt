SECTION 1. PROHIBITION ON PAY DURING GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN.

    (a) In General.--Members of Congress and the President shall not 
receive basic pay for any period in which--
            (1) there is more than a 24-hour lapse in appropriations 
        for any Federal agency or department as a result of a failure 
        to enact a regular appropriations bill or continuing 
        resolution; or
            (2) the Federal Government is unable to make payments or 
        meet obligations because the public debt limit under section

    (b) Retroactive Pay Prohibited.--No pay forfeited in accordance 
with subsection (a) may be paid retroactively.
