                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                               RESOLUTION


 
   To authorize the production of records by the Committee on Armed 
                               Services.

Whereas, the United States Air Force has initiated an independent review of the 
        case of Major General John D. Lavelle, who has been nominated to be 
        advanced posthumously on the retired list to the rank of general;
Whereas, the Committee has received a request from the Secretary of the Air 
        Force that those conducting the independent review of Major General 
        Lavelle's nomination be given access to the Committee's executive 
        session documents relating to Major General Lavelle's 1972 nomination to 
        the rank of lieutenant general on the retired list of the Air Force;
Whereas, by the privileges of the Senate of the United States and Rule XI of the 
        Standing Rules of the Senate, no evidence under the control or in the 
        possession of the Senate can, by administrative or judicial process, be 
        taken from such control or possession but by permission of the Senate;
Whereas, when it appears that evidence under the control or in the possession of 
        the Senate is needed for the promotion of justice, the Senate will take 
        such action as will promote the ends of justice consistent with the 
        privileges of the Senate: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of the 
Committee on Armed Services, acting jointly, are authorized to provide, 
under appropriate security procedures, records from the Committee's 
executive sessions relating to Major General John D. Lavelle's 1972 
nomination to those persons conducting the independent review of Major 
General Lavelle's case on behalf of the Air Force.
                                 <all>
