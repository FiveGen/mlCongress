                               RESOLUTION


 
   Designating April 15 through 17, 2011, as ``Global Youth Service 
                                Days''.

Whereas Global Youth Service Days is an annual campaign that celebrates and 
        mobilizes the millions of young people who improve their communities 
        each day through community service and service-learning programs;
Whereas the goals of Global Youth Service Days are--

    (1) to mobilize and support young people to address the needs of their 
communities, their countries, and the world through community service and 
service-learning;

    (2) to mobilize and support schools and organizations to provide 
meaningful opportunities for youth engagement;

    (3) to educate the public, the media, and policymakers about the year-
round contributions of young people as community leaders;

    (4) to recognize and celebrate young people as community assets, 
resources, leaders, and problem-solvers; and

    (5) to inspire and sustain a lifelong commitment to service and civic 
engagement;

Whereas Global Youth Service Days, a program of Youth Service America, is the 
        largest service event in the world and the only service event dedicated 
        to engaging young people ages 5 through 25;
Whereas, in 2011, Global Youth Service Days is being observed for the 23rd 
        consecutive year in the United States and for the 12th year globally in 
        more than 100 countries;
Whereas Global Youth Service Days provides an opportunity for young people to 
        position themselves as assets, resources, active citizens, and community 
        leaders through the application of their knowledge, idealism, energy, 
        creativity, and unique perspective to improving their communities by 
        addressing a myriad of critical issues, such as childhood obesity, 
        illiteracy, hunger, environmental degradation, public safety, and 
        disaster preparedness;
Whereas, in 2011, thousands of participants in schools and community-based 
        organizations plan to hold Global Youth Service Days activities as part 
        of a Semester of Service, an extended service-learning campaign launched 
        on Martin Luther King, Jr. Day of Service, in which young people spend 
        the semester addressing a meaningful community need connected to 
        intentional learning goals or academic standards over the course of at 
        least 70 hours;
Whereas Global Youth Service Days engages millions of young people worldwide 
        with the support of the Global Youth Service Network of the Youth 
        Service America, including more than 200 national and international 
        partners, 100 State and local lead agencies, and thousands of local 
        schools, afterschool programs, youth development organizations, 
        community organizations, faith-based organizations, government agencies, 
        businesses, neighborhood associations, and families;
Whereas, in 2011, Youth Service America intends to distribute more than 
        $1,000,000 in grants to more than 800 projects led by young people, 
        including State Farm GYSD Lead Agency and Good Neighbor grants, 
        UnitedHealth Heroes grants, Sodexo Youth and Lead Organizer grants, 
        Disney Friends for Change grants, Learn and Serve America STEMester of 
        Service grants, NEA Youth Leaders for Literacy grants, and MLK Semester 
        of Service Lead Organizer Grants;
Whereas high quality community service and service-learning programs increase--

    (1) the academic engagement and achievement of young people;

    (2) the workforce readiness and 21st century skills of young people;

    (3) the civic knowledge and engagement of young people;

    (4) the intercultural understanding and global citizenship of young 
people; and

    (5) the connectedness and commitment of young people to their 
communities; and

Whereas section 198(g) of the National and Community Service Act of 1990 (42 
        U.S.C. 12653(g)) recognizes Global Youth Service Days as national days 
        of service and calls on the Corporation for National and Community 
        Service, other Federal agencies and departments, and the President of 
        the United States to recognize and support youth-led activities on the 
        designated days: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes and commends the significant contributions 
        of young people of the United States and encourages the 
        continued engagement and support of young people dedicated to 
        serving their neighbors, their communities, and the United 
        States;
            (2) designates April 15 through 17, 2011, as ``Global Youth 
        Service Days''; and
            (3) calls on the people of the United States to observe 
        Global Youth Service Days by--
                    (A) encouraging young people to participate in 
                community service and service-learning projects and to 
                join their peers in those projects;
                    (B) recognizing the volunteer efforts of the young 
                people of the United States throughout the year; and
                    (C) supporting the volunteer efforts of young 
                people and engaging them in meaningful community 
                service, service-learning, and decision-making 
                opportunities as an investment in the future of the 
                United States.
