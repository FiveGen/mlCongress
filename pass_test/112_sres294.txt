                               RESOLUTION


 
 Commemorating the 182nd anniversary of the opening of the Chesapeake 
                          and Delaware Canal.

Whereas on October 17, 1829, the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal became 
        operational with the joint support of the Federal Government and the 
        States of Delaware, Maryland, and Pennsylvania;
Whereas the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal has served the economy of the 
        Chesapeake and Mid-Atlantic regions for 182 years, first as a lock-
        system canal and in the 20th century, as a free-flowing waterway;
Whereas the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal Museum recognizes and celebrates the 
        history of the Canal and the role of the Canal in the economic 
        development of the United States from the early 19th century through the 
        date of approval of this resolution;
Whereas the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal is 1 of only 2 commercially viable sea 
        level canals in the United States and is vital to the Ports of 
        Wilmington, Baltimore, and Philadelphia, as well as the broader United 
        States economy;
Whereas the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal is 1 of the busiest working waterways 
        in the world, with more than 25,000 vessels passing though the Canal 
        each year;
Whereas the Philadelphia District of the Corps of Engineers has responsibly 
        managed the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal since 1933, including 
        regularly dredging the Canal, maintaining existing bridges and roadways, 
        and managing maritime traffic;
Whereas in 2005 and 2006, public workshops were held to solicit ideas and 
        comments from local residents regarding potential recreational uses 
        along the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal;
Whereas in March 2006, the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal trail concept plan was 
        completed by the working group recommending the creation of a 
        recreational trail along both banks of the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal 
        to be used by walkers, joggers, cyclists, and equestrians;
Whereas the Federal Government and the State of Delaware have worked together to 
        provide funding to build the first phase of the recreational trail along 
        the banks of the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal, with construction set to 
        begin in the spring of 2012;
Whereas the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal is surrounded by more than 7,500 acres 
        of public land, creating a unique and safe environment for 
        recreationists, families, students, anglers, hunters, nature 
        enthusiasts, and others to participate in outdoor activities;
Whereas the recreational trail along the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal has the 
        potential to provide a common link to communities across the States of 
        Delaware and Maryland from Chesapeake City to Delaware City;
Whereas plans for Phase I of the recreational trail call for 9 miles of improved 
        trail along the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal from Delaware City to 
        Summit Marina, Delaware, including the construction of parking areas and 
        comfort stations;
Whereas public participation has been an integral part of the development of the 
        recreational trail along the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal and the plan 
        enjoys broad support from local communities, stakeholder groups, and 
        Federal and State officials; and
Whereas construction of the trail will create jobs and bring economic activity 
        to communities along the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal while encouraging 
        health and wellness through outdoor engagement: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) commemorates the 182nd anniversary of the opening of 
        the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal;
            (2) celebrates the history of the Chesapeake and Delaware 
        Canal as a facilitator of trade and economic development in the 
        Chesapeake and Mid-Atlantic regions;
            (3) honors the ongoing role that the Chesapeake and 
        Delaware Canal plays in supporting commerce by linking the 
        Delaware River and Chesapeake Bay to ports around the world; 
        and
            (4) recognizes the potential for recreation on federally 
        owned land along the banks of the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal 
        to encourage job creation, outdoor engagement, wellness, and 
        fitness.
