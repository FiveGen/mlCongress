Expressing the sense of the Senate regarding the June 30, 2011, opening 
           of the Tom Lantos Institute in Budapest, Hungary.

Whereas the late Congressman Tom Lantos was a champion of human and minority 
        rights in Europe and around the world;
Whereas Congressman Lantos, the only Holocaust survivor to be elected to the 
        United States Congress, was a leading voice on human rights and founding 
        co-chairman of the Congressional Human Rights Caucus, now known as the 
        Tom Lantos Human Rights Caucus;
Whereas Congressman Lantos always remained a proud Hungarian-American and an 
        active promoter of strong cooperation between the country of his birth 
        and the United States;
Whereas Congressman Lantos was a tireless advocate for tolerance and moderation, 
        virtues embodied in the stated mission of the Tom Lantos Institute in 
        Budapest;
Whereas the Tom Lantos Institute is a non-profit, non-partisan, and independent 
        organization supported by the Government of Hungary and dedicated to the 
        goal of promoting human and minority rights in Central and Eastern 
        Europe;
Whereas educational programs on human and minority rights will lay the 
        foundation for a more sustainable and inclusive peace; and
Whereas a strong transatlantic partnership is in the mutual interests of the 
        United States and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate--
            (1) to recognize and applaud the opening of the Tom Lantos 
        Institute;
            (2) to acknowledge the Government of Hungary for honoring 
        the legacy of Congressman Lantos through its contributions to 
        the Institute;
            (3) to express support for the principles of the Institute, 
        including democracy, pluralism, and human and minority rights;
            (4) to express support for the education of present and 
        future generations in Central and Eastern Europe, which will 
        contribute to regional cooperation, historical reconciliation, 
        and tolerance throughout the Euro-Atlantic region; and
            (5) to encourage the people and the governments of the 
        United States and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe 
        to continue to deepen and broaden their relations.
