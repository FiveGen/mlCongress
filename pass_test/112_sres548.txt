                               RESOLUTION


 
Designating the week beginning September 9, 2012, as ``National Direct 
               Support Professionals Recognition Week''.

Whereas direct support professionals, direct care workers, personal assistants, 
        personal attendants, in-home support workers, and paraprofessionals 
        (referred to in this preamble as ``direct support professionals'') are 
        the primary providers of publicly funded long term supports and services 
        for millions of individuals with disabilities;
Whereas a direct support professional must build a close, trusted relationship 
        with an individual with disabilities;
Whereas a direct support professional assists an individual with disabilities 
        with the most intimate needs on a daily basis;
Whereas direct support professionals perform a broad range of activities for 
        individuals with disabilities, including preparing meals, managing 
        medications, bathing, dressing, helping with mobility, providing 
        transportation to school, work, and religious and recreational 
        activities, and helping with general daily affairs;
Whereas a direct support professional provides essential support to help keep an 
        individual with disabilities connected to the family and community of 
        the individual;
Whereas direct support professionals enable individuals with disabilities to 
        live meaningful, productive lives;
Whereas direct support professionals are the key to allowing an individual with 
        disabilities to live successfully in the community and avoid more costly 
        institutional care;
Whereas the majority of direct support professionals are female, and many are 
        the sole breadwinners of their families;
Whereas, although direct support professionals work and pay taxes, many are 
        impoverished and are eligible for the same Federal and State public 
        assistance programs that individuals with disabilities depend on;
Whereas Federal policies, State policies, and the opinion of the Supreme Court 
        in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999) assert the right of an 
        individual to live in his or her home and community;
Whereas the majority of direct support professionals are employed in home and 
        community-based settings, and the percentage of direct support 
        professionals employed in such settings is projected to increase during 
        this decade;
Whereas there is a documented critical and growing shortage of direct support 
        professionals in every community throughout the United States; and
Whereas many direct support professionals are forced to leave jobs due to 
        inadequate wages and benefits, creating high turnover and vacancy rates, 
        which, research demonstrates, adversely affects the quality of supports 
        provided to individuals with disabilities: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates the week beginning September 9, 2012, as 
        ``National Direct Support Professionals Recognition Week'';
            (2) recognizes the dedication and vital role of direct 
        support professionals, direct care workers, personal 
        assistants, personal attendants, in-home support workers, and 
        paraprofessionals (referred to in this resolution as ``direct 
        support professionals'') in enhancing the lives of individuals 
        of all ages with disabilities;
            (3) appreciates the contribution of direct support 
        professionals in serving needs that are beyond the capacity of 
        millions of families in the United States;
            (4) commends direct support professionals as integral 
        participants in the long-term support and services system of 
        the United States; and
            (5) finds that the successful implementation of the public 
        policies of the United States depends on the dedication of 
        direct support professionals.
