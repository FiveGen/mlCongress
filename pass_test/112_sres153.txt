                               RESOLUTION


 
  Recognizing the 25th anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster.

Whereas at 1:23 A.M. on April 26, 1986, during an experiment, a major explosion 
        occurred at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Unit 4, a RBMK 1000-
        type, graphite-moderated nuclear power reactor in Pripyat;
Whereas the initial explosion dispersed a stream of radioactive particles over 
        nearby towns, farms, and eventually to many other countries;
Whereas 500,000 brave firefighters, engineers, technicians, and emergency 
        workers worked for more than 6 months to minimize one of the worst 
        civilian nuclear disasters in history;
Whereas radioactivity emanating from the Chernobyl disaster has been detected in 
        Belarus, Poland, Russia, Scandinavia, and other areas;
Whereas since the disaster, serious health, environmental, and socioeconomic 
        repercussions have been identified in many areas near the Chernobyl 
        plant;
Whereas the Chernobyl Forum, an initiative by the International Atomic Energy 
        Agency in cooperation with the World Health Organization, numerous 
        United Nations agencies, and the governments of Ukraine, Belarus, and 
        Russia, was launched in 2003 to examine the scientific evidence of human 
        and environmental effects of the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl;
Whereas the Chernobyl Forum's examination of the catastrophe has contributed to 
        the understanding of the effects caused by the nuclear disaster;
Whereas, the Chernobyl Forum found that more than 5,000,000 people lived in 
        ``contaminated'' areas in Ukraine, Belarus, Russia, and other countries;
Whereas the lives and wellness of people in the affected areas continue to be 
        impacted by the catastrophic Chernobyl nuclear disaster;
Whereas the government of the United States, the people of the United States, 
        and the international community have provided contributions to 
        humanitarian organizations to address the effects of the Chernobyl 
        disaster;
Whereas the Chernobyl Shelter Fund (CSF) was established in December 1997 by the 
        G7, in cooperation with Ukraine;
Whereas the purpose of the CSF has been to construct a safe confinement over the 
        damaged Chernobyl Unit 4 and to convert the site to a stable and 
        environmentally safe condition;
Whereas the Nuclear Safety Account (NSA), supported by the United States and 16 
        other donors, finances the Interim Spent Fuel Storage Facility that 
        allows for the decommissioning of Chernobyl Units 1 through 3;
Whereas April 26, 2011, is the 25th anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear 
        disaster; and
Whereas the ongoing crisis in Japan at the Fukushima nuclear power plant serves 
        as a reminder to the United States and the international community of 
        the need to make strong commitments to nuclear security throughout the 
        world: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes the 25th anniversary of the Chernobyl 
        nuclear disaster and the courage of the Ukrainian people in 
        persevering to address the consequences of the disaster;
            (2) commends efforts to mitigate the consequences of the 
        Chernobyl nuclear disaster; and
            (3) requests that the Secretary of the Senate transmit an 
        enrolled copy of this resolution to the Ambassador of Ukraine 
        to the United States.
                                 <all>
