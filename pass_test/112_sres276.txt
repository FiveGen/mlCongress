                               RESOLUTION


 
    Expressing support for the goals and ideals of National Infant 
                    Mortality Awareness Month 2011.

Whereas ``infant mortality'' refers to the death of a baby before his or her 
        first birthday;
Whereas the United States ranks 41st among industrialized countries in the rate 
        of infant mortality;
Whereas high rates of infant mortality are especially prevalent in communities 
        with large minority populations, high rates of unemployment and poverty, 
        and limited access to safe housing and medical providers;
Whereas premature birth is a leading cause of infant mortality;
Whereas according to the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies, 
        premature birth costs the United States more than $26,000,000,000 
        annually;
Whereas infant mortality can be substantially reduced through community-based 
        services such as outreach, home visitation, case management, health 
        education, and interconceptional care;
Whereas support for community-based programs to reduce infant mortality can 
        result in lower future spending on medical interventions, special 
        education, and other social services that may be needed for infants and 
        children who are born with a low birth weight;
Whereas the Department of Health and Human Services, through the Office of 
        Minority Health, has implemented the ``A Healthy Baby Begins With You'' 
        campaign;
Whereas the Maternal and Child Health Bureau of the Health Resources and 
        Services Administration has provided national leadership on the issue of 
        infant mortality;
Whereas public awareness and education campaigns on infant mortality are held 
        during the month of September each year; and
Whereas September 2011 has been designated as ``National Infant Mortality 
        Awareness Month'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of National Infant 
        Mortality Awareness Month 2011;
            (2) supports efforts to educate people in the United States 
        about infant mortality and the factors that contribute to 
        infant mortality;
            (3) supports efforts to reduce infant deaths, low birth 
        weight, pre-term births, and disparities in perinatal outcomes;
            (4) recognizes the critical importance of including efforts 
        to reduce infant mortality and the factors that contribute to 
        infant mortality as part of prevention and wellness strategies; 
        and
            (5) calls upon the people of the United States to observe 
        National Infant Mortality Awareness Month with appropriate 
        programs and activities.
                                 <all>
