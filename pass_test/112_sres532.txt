                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing support for the XIX International AIDS Conference and the 
 sense of the Senate that continued commitment by the United States to 
  HIV/AIDS research, prevention, and treatment programs is crucial to 
                       protecting global health.

Whereas, according to UNAIDS, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, 
        there are approximately 33,400,000 people living with HIV worldwide, and 
        nearly 30,000,000 people have died of AIDS since the first cases were 
        reported in 1981;
Whereas, in the United States, more than 1,000,000 people are living with HIV 
        and approximately 50,000 people become newly infected with the virus 
        each year;
Whereas, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1 in 5 
        individuals living with HIV is unaware of the infection, underscoring 
        the need for greater education about HIV/AIDS and access to testing;
Whereas societal stigma remains a significant challenge to addressing HIV/AIDS;
Whereas the United States is heavily engaged in both international and domestic 
        efforts to address the HIV/AIDS pandemic, including--

    (1) the United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief 
(commonly known as ``PEPFAR'');

    (2) the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria;

    (3) title XXIV of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300dd et 
seq.) (originally enacted as part of the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS 
Resources Emergency Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-381; 104 Stat. 576));

    (4) State AIDS Drug Assistance Programs;

    (5) the Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS program of the 
Department of Housing and Urban Development; and

    (6) AIDS research at the National Institutes of Health and other 
agencies;

Whereas, since 1985, the now biennial International AIDS Conference has brought 
        together leading scientists, public health experts, policymakers, 
        community leaders, and individuals living with HIV/AIDS from around the 
        world to enhance the global response to HIV/AIDS, evaluate recent 
        scientific developments, share knowledge, and facilitate a collective 
        strategy to combat the HIV/AIDS pandemic;
Whereas, in 2008, Congress passed and the President signed into law the Tom 
        Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/
        AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 (Public Law 
        110-293; 122 Stat. 2918);
Whereas taxpayers in the United States have paid more than $45,000,000,000 
        through PEPFAR and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and 
        Malaria, which have enjoyed broad bipartisan support in Congress;
Whereas, 25 years after the III International AIDS Conference was held in 
        Washington, D.C., the XIX International AIDS Conference (referred to in 
        this preamble as ``AIDS 2012'') will take place from July 22, 2012, 
        through July 27, 2012, at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center, in 
        Washington, D.C.;
Whereas AIDS 2012, organized by the International AIDS Society, is expected to 
        convene more than 20,000 delegates, including 2,000 journalists, from 
        nearly 200 countries;
Whereas the theme of AIDS 2012, ``Turning the Tide Together'', embodies the 
        promise and urgency of utilizing recent scientific advances in HIV/AIDS 
        treatment and biomedical prevention, continuing research for an HIV 
        vaccine and cure, and increasing effective, evidence-based interventions 
        in key settings to change the course of the HIV/AIDS crisis;
Whereas AIDS 2012 seeks to engage governments, nongovernmental organizations, 
        policymakers, the scientific community, the private sector, civil 
        society, faith-based organizations, the media, and people living with 
        HIV/AIDS to more effectively address regional, national, and local 
        responses to HIV/AIDS around the world and overcome barriers that limit 
        access to preventative care, treatment, and other services; and
Whereas AIDS 2012 is a tremendous opportunity to strengthen the role of the 
        United States in global HIV/AIDS initiatives within the context of 
        significant global economic challenges, reenergize the response to the 
        domestic epidemic, and focus particular attention on the devastating 
        impact of HIV/AIDS that continues in the United States: Now, therefore, 
        be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) supports the XIX International AIDS Conference and the 
        goal of renewing awareness of, and commitment to, addressing 
        the HIV/AIDS crisis in the United States and abroad;
            (2) recognizes that continued HIV/AIDS research, 
        prevention, and treatment programs are crucial to improving 
        global health;
            (3) understands that the key to overcoming HIV/AIDS 
        includes efforts to formulate sound public health policy, 
        protect human rights, address the needs of women and girls, 
        direct effective programming toward the populations at the 
        highest risk of infection, ensure accountability, and combat 
        stigma, poverty, and other social challenges related to HIV/
        AIDS;
            (4) seeks to work with all stakeholders--
                    (A) to prevent the transmission of HIV;
                    (B) to increase access to testing, treatment, and 
                care;
                    (C) to improve health outcomes for all people 
                living with HIV/AIDS; and
                    (D) to foster greater scientific and programmatic 
                collaborations around the world to translate scientific 
                advances and apply best practices to international 
                efforts to end HIV/AIDS;
            (5) commits to supporting a stronger global response to 
        HIV/AIDS, protecting the rights of people living with HIV/AIDS, 
        and working to create an ``AIDS-free generation''; and
            (6) encourages the ongoing development in the public and 
        private sectors of innovative therapies and advances in 
        clinical treatment for HIV/AIDS, including--
                    (A) new and improved biomedical and behavioral 
                prevention strategies;
                    (B) safer and more affordable, accessible, and 
                effective treatment regimens for infected individuals; 
                and
                    (C) research for an HIV vaccine and cure.
                                 <all>
