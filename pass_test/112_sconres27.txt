                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
  Honoring the service of Sergeant First Class Leroy Arthur Petry, a 
native of Santa Fe, New Mexico, and the second living recipient of the 
                 Medal of Honor since the Vietnam War.

Whereas Sergeant First Class Leroy Arthur Petry of the United States Army, a 
        native of Santa Fe, New Mexico, was awarded the Medal of Honor by 
        President Obama on July 12, 2011;
Whereas the Medal of Honor is the highest honor awarded to members of the Armed 
        Forces for valor in combat;
Whereas the official citation awarding the Medal of Honor to Sergeant First 
        Class Petry states that then-Staff Sergeant Petry ``distinguished 
        himself by acts of gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life 
        above and beyond the call of duty in action with an armed enemy in the 
        vicinity of Paktya Province, Afghanistan, on May 26, 2008'';
Whereas Sergeant First Class Petry joins an elite group of Medal of Honor 
        recipients dating back to the Civil War;
Whereas Sergeant First Class Petry has continued a long tradition of military 
        service to the United States by New Mexicans, dating back to the defense 
        of the Western United States during the Civil War, and followed by 
        participation in every major war fought by the United States;
Whereas Sergeant First Class Petry is the second living recipient of the Medal 
        of Honor since the Vietnam War;
Whereas Sergeant First Class Petry fought with bravery and, despite wounds to 
        both of his legs, had the courage and quick thinking needed to save the 
        lives of his fellow soldiers by throwing back an enemy grenade and 
        losing his right hand when the grenade detonated shortly after he 
        released it;
Whereas the actions of Sergeant First Class Petry represent the highest values 
        of the Army, the Rangers, and the United States;
Whereas Sergeant First Class Petry has consistently demonstrated humility and 
        dedication to his fellow soldiers;
Whereas Sergeant First Class Petry, who overcame a troubled youth and found the 
        strength to turn his life around and dedicate himself to serving the 
        United States, is an example to all people who are struggling in the 
        United States; and
Whereas the brave actions of Sergeant First Class Petry, as well as his modesty 
        and selfless service, stand as the embodiment of the best attributes of 
        the people of the United States: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring), 
That Congress--
            (1) honors the service and sacrifice of Sergeant First 
        Class Leroy Arthur Petry of the United States Army and his 
        family; and
            (2) encourages the people of the United States to recognize 
        the valor, heroism, and dedication to the United States 
        exhibited by Sergeant First Class Petry.

            Passed the Senate September 23, 2011.

            Attest:

                                                NANCY ERICKSON,

                                                             Secretary.
