purposes'', approved March 3, 1925 (2 U.S.C. 160), is amended--
            (1) in the first sentence, by striking ``in the name of the 
        United States'' and all that follows and inserting the 
        following: ``in the name of the United States and in the 
        interest of the Library, its collections, or its service, gifts 
        or bequests of money for immediate disbursement, personal 
        property valued at $25,000 or less, nonpersonal services, or 
        voluntary and uncompensated personal services.'';
            (2) in the second sentence, by inserting ``of money'' after 
        ``bequests''; and
            (3) in the third sentence, by striking ``enter them'' and 
        inserting ``enter the gift, bequest, or proceeds''.
    (b) Treatment of Gifts of Securities.--The first undesignated 
paragraph of section 4 of such Act (2 U.S.C. 160) is amended by 
inserting after the first sentence the following new sentence: ``In the 
case of a gift of securities, the Librarian shall sell the gift and 
provide the donor with a receipt from the proceeds of the sale.''.
    (c) Public Report on Accepted Gifts.--Section 4 of such Act (2 
U.S.C. 160) is amended--
            (1) in the first sentence of the first undesignated 
        paragraph, by striking ``Nothing'' and inserting ``(a) 
        Acceptance and Disbursement of Gifts.--Nothing''; and
            (2) by adding at the end the following new subsection:
    ``(b) Public Report on Accepted Gifts.--In each Annual Report of 
the Library of Congress, the Librarian of Congress shall include a 
description of each gift or bequest accepted under this section during 
the year involved which is valued at $1,000 or more.''.

            Passed the House of Representatives September 10, 2012.

            Attest:

                                                 KAREN L. HAAS,
