                               RESOLUTION


 
 Commemorating the 20th anniversary of United States Strategic Command.

Whereas United States Strategic Command was established on June 1, 1992, to meet 
        national security needs of the post-cold-war era by combining all 
        strategic planning, targeting, and wartime employment of forces under 
        one commander headquartered at Offutt Air Force Base in the State of 
        Nebraska;
Whereas United States Strategic Command was reestablished in 2002 at Offutt Air 
        Force Base, combining the responsibilities of United States Strategic 
        Command and the United States Space Command along with responsibility 
        for early warning and defense against missile attack;
Whereas over the last 20 years, United States Strategic Command has flawlessly 
        executed the mission to deter nuclear attacks and employ nuclear forces 
        if necessary;
Whereas in 2010 the mission of United States Strategic Command expanded again to 
        include cyberspace operations through United States Cyber Command, a 
        subunified command;
Whereas United States Strategic Command provides continuous information 
        regarding orbiting satellites and space debris to spacecraft such as the 
        International Space Station;
Whereas United States Strategic Command has supported coalition forces in Iraq 
        and Afghanistan by providing intelligence, planning, and cyber support;
Whereas United States Strategic Command contributed to United States operations 
        in Libya through long-range conventional strikes and intelligence, 
        surveillance, and reconnaissance;
Whereas United States Strategic Command continues to be the premier nuclear 
        deterrent in the United States, serving as a center for global command 
        and communications headquartered in the State of Nebraska; and
Whereas the United States, and particularly the State of Nebraska, is grateful 
        to those who serve the United States at United States Strategic Command: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes the 20th anniversary of the establishment of 
        United States Strategic Command and the vital contributions of 
        United States Strategic Command to national security; and
            (2) honors the dedicated men and women who serve at United 
        States Strategic Command executing the mission to deter and 
        detect strategic attack against the United States and allies of 
        the United States and to defend the nation as directed.
                                 <all>
