                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                             March 17, 2011

 Mrs. Gillibrand (for herself, Mr. Schumer, and Mrs. Murray) submitted 
      the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
 Recognizing the 100th anniversary of the Triangle Shirtwaist Company 
 fire in New York City on March 25, 1911, and designating the week of 
 March 21, 2011, through March 25, 2011, as the ``100th Anniversary of 
        the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire Remembrance Week''.

Whereas the Triangle Shirtwaist Company fire was the deadliest industrial 
        disaster in the City of New York's history and resulted in the 4th 
        greatest loss of life from an industrial accident in the history of the 
        United States, claiming the lives of 146 garment workers, many of whom 
        were young immigrants;
Whereas this human catastrophe exposed the need to strengthen labor laws, fire 
        regulations, and health and safety protections for workers;
Whereas the Triangle Shirtwaist Company fire helped spur the growth of the 
        modern-day organized labor movement, particularly the International 
        Ladies' Garment Workers' Union, which continued to fight for better 
        conditions for sweatshop workers;
Whereas from the ashes of this horrific event emerged the modern celebration of 
        International Women's Day, and the death of 129 women workers in the 
        Triangle Shirtwaist Company fire demonstrated the need for workers' 
        rights and women's rights;
Whereas more than 5,000 workers lose their lives each year on the job, and 
        protecting the health and safety of workers continues to be a critical 
        issue in the United States today; and
Whereas national events will be held to remember the victims of the Triangle 
        Shirtwaist Company fire, and to educate citizens about the important 
        role this tragic event played in the history of the United States: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate designates the week of March 21, 2011 
through March 25, 2011 as the ``100th Anniversary of the Triangle 
Shirtwaist Factory Fire Remembrance Week''.
