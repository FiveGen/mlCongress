 Recognizing the teachers of the United States for their contributions 
             to the development and progress of our Nation.

Whereas education is the foundation of the current and future strength of the 
        United States;
Whereas teachers and other education staff have earned and deserve the respect 
        of students and communities for selfless dedication to our Nation's 
        children;
Whereas the purpose of ``National Teacher Appreciation Week'' is to raise public 
        awareness of the important contributions of teachers and to promote 
        greater respect and understanding for the teaching profession;
Whereas the teachers of the United States play an important role in preparing 
        children to be positive and contributing members of society; and
Whereas students, schools, communities, and a number of organizations host 
        teacher appreciation events in recognition of ``National Teacher 
        Appreciation Week'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) thanks teachers for their service;
            (2) promotes the profession of teaching; and
            (3) recognizes students, parents, school administrators, 
        and public officials who participate in teacher appreciation 
        events during ``National Teacher Appreciation Week''.
