support for designation of July 2012 as World Choir Games Month in the 
                             United States.

Whereas the World Choir Games, the largest choral competition in the world, 
        takes place every 2 years, is known as the ``Olympics of choral music'', 
        and has the goal of uniting people from all countries through singing in 
        peaceful competition;
Whereas, from July 4 through July 14, 2012, Cincinnati, Ohio, will be first city 
        in the United States to host the World Choir Games;
Whereas the Seventh World Choir Games are expected to include more than 400 
        choirs from more than 70 countries, 20,000 official participants, 
        including performers, event officials, delegations, and international 
        jury members, and up to 200,000 spectators;
Whereas choirs will compete in 23 different musical genres evaluated by an 
        impartial international jury of choral music experts;
Whereas the genres of barbershop and show choir will be added as competition 
        categories for the first time in recognition of their popularity in the 
        United States;
Whereas the uniting of the people of the world through singing in peaceful 
        competition in the United States in 2012 affirms the commitment of the 
        United States to global cultural awareness, understanding, and 
        appreciation; and
Whereas it is appropriate to designate July 2012 as World Choir Games Month in 
        the United States: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes the global significance of the Seventh World 
        Choir Games to be hosted in Cincinnati, Ohio, from July 4 
        through July 14, 2012;
            (2) recognizes Interkultur, the Cincinnati Organizing 
        Committee for the Seventh World Choir Games, the Cincinnati USA 
        Convention and Visitors Bureau, the city of Cincinnati, and the 
        State of Ohio for their efforts to secure and host the World 
        Choir Games;
            (3) expresses appreciation to all people of the world who 
        will participate in the World Choir Games, either in 
        competition or as visitors, and to all of the volunteers who 
        will welcome the participants and other visitors to the United 
        States;
            (4) supports the designation of July 2012 as World Choir 
        Games Month in the United States; and
            (5) renews the commitment of the United States to world 
        peace and friendship and increasing global cultural 
        understanding through singing in peaceful competition.
