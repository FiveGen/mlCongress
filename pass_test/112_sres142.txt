        Basketball Championship (referred to in this preamble as the ``national 
        championship'') by defeating Notre Dame by a score of 76 to 70, becoming

        White;

        team;
Whereas All-American Danielle Adams scored 30 points, the second-highest number 
        of points ever scored in a national championship game, and finished the

Whereas the Lady Aggies should all be commended for their teamwork;
Whereas Texas A&M University joins the ranks of the University of Texas, Baylor, 
        and Texas Tech as women's basketball national champions, demonstrating
