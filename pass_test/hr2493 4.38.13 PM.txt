            (1) Calculation.--The fee for each animal unit month in a 
        grazing fee year for livestock grazing on Federal lands in the 
        sixteen contiguous western States shall be equal to the 12-year 
        average of the total gross value of production for beef cattle 
        for the 12 years preceding the grazing fee year, multiplied by 
        the 12-year average of the United States Treasury Securities 
        six-month bill ``new issue'' rate, and divided by 12. The gross 
        value of production for beef cattle shall be determined by the 
        Economic Research Service of the Department of Agriculture in 
        accordance with subsection (d)(1).
            (2) Fee for foreign-owned or controlled grazing permits or 
        leases.--In the case of a grazing permit or lease held or 
        otherwise controlled in whole or in part by a foreign 
        corporation or a foreign individual, the fee shall be equal to 
        the higher of the following:
                    (A) The average grazing fee (weighted by animal 
                unit months) charged by the State during the previous 
                grazing year for grazing on State lands in the State in 
                which the lands covered by the grazing permit or lease 
                are located.
                    (B) The average grazing fee (weighted by animal 
                unit months) charged for grazing on private lands in 
                the State in which the lands covered by the grazing 
                permit or lease are located.
    (b) Definition of Animal Unit Month.--For the purposes of billing 
only, the term ``animal unit month'' means one month's use and 
occupancy of range by--
            (1) one cow, bull, steer, heifer, horse, burro, or mule, 
        seven sheep, or seven goats, each of which is six months of age 
        or older on the date on which the animal begins grazing on 
        Federal lands;
            (2) any such animal regardless of age if the animal is 
        weaned on the date on which the animal begins grazing on 
        Federal lands; and
            (3) any such animal that will become 12 months of age 
        during the period of use authorized under a grazing permit.
    (c) Livestock Not Counted.--There shall not be counted as an animal 
unit month the use of Federal lands for grazing by an animal that is 
less than six months of age on the date on which the animal begins 
grazing on such lands and is the progeny of an animal on which a 
grazing fee is paid if the animal is removed from such lands before 
becoming 12 months of age.
    (d) Criteria for Economic Research Service.--
            (1) Gross value of production of beef cattle.--The Economic 
        Research Service of the Department of Agriculture shall 
        continue to compile and report the gross value of production of 
        beef cattle, on a dollars-per-bred-cow basis for the United 
        States, as is currently published by the Service in: ``Economic 
        Indicators of the Farm Sector: Cost of Production--Major Field 
        Crops and Livestock and Dairy'' (Cow-calf production cash costs 
        and returns).
            (2) Availability.--For the purposes of determining the 
        grazing fee for a given grazing fee year, the gross value of 
        production (as described above) for the previous calendar year 
        shall be made available to the Secretary concerned, and 
        published in the Federal Register, on or before February 15 of 
        each year.
    (e) Treatment of Other Fees and Charges.--
            (1) Amount of flpma fees and charges.--The fees and charges 
        under section 304(a) of the Federal Land Policy and Management 
        Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1734(a)) shall reflect processing costs 
        and shall be adjusted periodically as such costs change, but in 
        no case shall such fees and charges exceed the actual 
        administrative and processing costs incurred by the Secretary 
        concerned.
            (2) Notice of changes.--Notice of a change in a service 
        charge shall be published in the Federal Register.
