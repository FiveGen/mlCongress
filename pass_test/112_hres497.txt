H. Res. 497

                In the House of Representatives, U. S.,

                                                     December 19, 2011.
Whereas Sir Winston Churchill was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1940 
        through 1945 and from 1951 through 1955;
Whereas the United States and the United Kingdom led the Allied Powers during 
        World War Two;
Whereas President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Sir Winston Churchill formed a 
        bond that united freedom-loving people throughout the world to defeat 
        tyranny in Europe and Asia;
Whereas, on December 26, 1941, Sir Winston Churchill addressed a Joint Session 
        of Congress;
Whereas during that speech, Sir Winston Churchill said, ``Sure I am that this 
        day--now we are the masters of our fate; that the task which has been 
        set us is not above our strength; that its pangs and toils are not 
        beyond our endurance. As long as we have faith in our cause and an 
        unconquerable will-power, salvation will not be denied us. In the words 
        of the Psalmist, `He shall not be afraid of evil tidings; his heart is 
        fixed, trusting in the Lord.' Not all the tidings will be evil.'';
Whereas December 26, 2011, is the 70th anniversary of this speech to a joint 
        session of Congress;
Whereas Sir Winston Churchill was made an Honorary Citizen of the United States 
        by an act of Congress in 1963;
Whereas Sir Winston Churchill was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal in 1969;
Whereas Sir Winston Churchill's persistence, determination and resolve remains 
        an inspiration to freedom-fighters all over the world;
Whereas the United Kingdom remains and will forever be an important and 
        irreplaceable ally to the United States; and
Whereas the United States Capitol does not currently appropriately recognize the 
        contributions of Sir Winston Churchill or that of the United Kingdom: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Architect of the Capitol place an appropriate statue or 
bust of Sir Winston Churchill in the United States Capitol at a location 
directed by the House Fine Arts Board in consultation with the Speaker.
            Attest:

                                                                          Clerk.
