                               RESOLUTION


 
Commemorating the success of Team USA in the past 25 Olympic Games and 
     supporting Team USA in the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.

Whereas, for over 100 years, the Olympic Movement has built a more peaceful and 
        better world by educating young people through amateur athletics, 
        bringing together athletes from many countries in friendly competition, 
        and forging new relationships bound by friendship, solidarity, and fair 
        play;
Whereas the 2012 Olympic Games will take place in London, England from July 27, 
        2012 to August 12, 2012, and the 2012 Paralympic Games will take place 
        from August 29, 2012 to September 9, 2012;
Whereas, at the 2012 Olympic Games, over 200 nations will compete in over 300 
        events, and Team USA will compete in 246 events;
Whereas, at the 2012 Olympic Games, over 200 nations will compete in 39 
        disciplines, and Team USA will compete in 38 of those disciplines;
Whereas 529 Olympians and over 245 Paralympians will compete on behalf of Team 
        USA in London, England;
Whereas Team USA has won 934 gold medals, 730 silver medals, and 643 bronze 
        medals, totaling 2,307 medals over the past 25 Olympic Games;
Whereas the people of the United States stand united in respect and admiration 
        for the members of the United States Olympic and Paralympic teams, and 
        the athletic accomplishments, sportsmanship, and dedication to 
        excellence of the teams;
Whereas the many accomplishments of the United States Olympic and Paralympic 
        teams would not have been possible without the hard work and dedication 
        of many others, including the United States Olympic Committee and the 
        many administrators, coaches, and family members who provided critical 
        support to the athletes;
Whereas the Nation takes great pride in the qualities of commitment to 
        excellence, grace under pressure, and good will toward other competitors 
        exhibited by the athletes of Team USA; and
Whereas the Olympic Movement celebrates competition, fair play, and the pursuit 
        of dreams: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) applauds all of the athletes and coaches of Team USA 
        and their families who support them;
            (2) supports the athletes of Team USA in their endeavors at 
        the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games held in London, England;
            (3) thanks all of the members of the United States Olympics 
        Committee for their unwavering support of the athletes of Team 
        USA; and
            (4) supports the goals and ideals of the Olympic Games.
                                 <all>
