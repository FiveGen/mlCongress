   Expressing the sense of the Senate that public servants should be 
  commended for their dedication and continued service to the Nation 
     during Public Service Recognition Week, May 1 through 7, 2011.

Whereas Public Service Recognition Week provides an opportunity to recognize and 
        promote the important contributions of public servants and honor the 
        diverse men and women who meet the needs of the Nation through work at 
        all levels of government;
Whereas millions of individuals work in government service in every city, 
        county, and State across America and in hundreds of cities abroad;
Whereas public service is a noble calling involving a variety of challenging and 
        rewarding professions;
Whereas Federal, State, and local governments are responsive, innovative, and 
        effective because of the outstanding work of public servants;
Whereas the United States of America is a great and prosperous Nation, and 
        public service employees contribute significantly to that greatness and 
        prosperity;
Whereas the Nation benefits daily from the knowledge and skills of these highly 
        trained individuals;
Whereas public servants--

Whereas members of the uniformed services and civilian employees at all levels 
        of government make significant contributions to the general welfare of 
        the United States, and are on the front lines in the fight against 
        terrorism and in maintaining homeland security;
Whereas public servants work in a professional manner to build relationships 
        with other countries and cultures in order to better represent America's 
        interests and promote American ideals;
Whereas public servants alert Congress and the public to government waste, 
        fraud, abuse, and dangers to public health;
Whereas the men and women serving in the Armed Forces of the United States, as 
        well as those skilled trade and craft Federal employees who provide 
        support to their efforts, are committed to doing their jobs regardless 
        of the circumstances, and contribute greatly to the security of the 
        Nation and the world;
Whereas public servants have bravely fought in armed conflict in defense of this 
        Nation and its ideals and deserve the care and benefits they have earned 
        through their honorable service;
Whereas government workers have much to offer, as demonstrated by their 
        expertise and innovative ideas, and serve as examples by passing on 
        institutional knowledge to train the next generation of public servants;
Whereas May 1 through 7, 2011, has been designated Public Service Recognition 
        Week to honor America's Federal, State, and local government employees; 
        and
Whereas Public Service Recognition Week is celebrating its 27th anniversary: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
