                               RESOLUTION


 
  Congratulating the Eastern Washington University football team for 
 winning the 2010 National Collegiate Athletic Association Division 1 
                Football Championship Subdivision title.

Whereas on January 7, 2011, the Eastern Washington University football team 
        (referred to in this preamble as the ``Eagles'') defeated the University 
        of Delaware Blue Hens by a score of 20 to 19, to win the 2010 National 
        Collegiate Athletic Association Division 1 Football Championship 
        Subdivision title;
Whereas the Eagles were down for most of the championship game, trailing 0 to 19 
        until late in the third quarter;
Whereas, it was not until 1 minute and 48 seconds remained in the third quarter 
        of the championship game that quarterback Bo Levi Mitchell threw a 22-
        yard touchdown pass to Brandon Kaufman;
Whereas Mitchell then threw another touchdown to Nicholas Edwards with 8 minutes 
        and 16 seconds left in the fourth quarter;
Whereas Mitchell threw a third touchdown, again to Kaufman, with 2 minutes and 
        47 seconds left in the game, clinching a win in the Eagles' first trip 
        to the National Collegiate Athletic Association Division 1 Football 
        Championship Subdivision game;
Whereas the Eagles began the 2010 season in the newly renovated and dedicated 
        Roos Field, named after Eastern Washington University alumnus and 
        offensive lineman Michael Roos of the National Football League's 
        Tennessee Titans;
Whereas Roos Field is the only Division 1 college football stadium to feature a 
        red playing surface, leading Roos Field to be aptly nicknamed ``The 
        Inferno'';
Whereas head coach Beau Baldwin was named the Coach of the Year by College 
        Sporting News;
Whereas the 2010 Buck Buchanan Award, honoring the most outstanding defensive 
        player in the Division I Football Championship Subdivision, was awarded 
        to Eagles linebacker J.C. Sherritt;
Whereas Big Sky Conference honors were awarded to Eagles running back Taiwan 
        Jones, who was named Offensive Player of the Year, and Eagles linebacker 
        J.C. Sherritt, who was named Defensive Player of the Year;
Whereas the Eagles clinched a share of the 2010 Big Sky Conference title, with a 
        conference record of 7-1 and an overall season record of 13-2, and 
        finished the 2010 season with an 11-game win streak; and
Whereas the Eagles enjoyed widespread support from their dedicated and spirited 
        fans, as well as the entire Eastern Washington University community: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) congratulates the Eastern Washington University 
        football team for winning the National Collegiate Athletic 
        Association Division 1 Football Championship Subdivision title;
            (2) recognizes the hard work and dedication of the players, 
        head coach Beau Baldwin, and the assistant coaches and support 
        personnel who all played critical roles in helping the Eastern 
        Washington University Eagles win the Subdivision title; and
            (3) respectfully requests the Secretary of the Senate to 
        transmit an enrolled copy of the resolution to--
                    (A) the President of Eastern Washington University, 
                Dr. Rodolfo Arevalo;
                    (B) the Athletic Director of Eastern Washington 
                University, Bill Chaves; and
                    (C) the Head Coach of the Eastern Washington 
                University football team, Beau Baldwin.
                                 <all>
