                               RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing the sense of the Senate in support of the North Atlantic 
    Treaty Organization and the NATO summit to be held in Chicago, 
                Illinois, from May 20 through 21, 2012.

Whereas the North Atlantic Treaty, signed April 4, 1949, in Washington, District 
        of Columbia, which created the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
        (referred to in this preamble as ``NATO''), proclaims: ``[Members] are 
        determined to safeguard the freedom, common heritage and civilisation of 
        their peoples, founded on the principles of democracy, individual 
        liberty and the rule of law. They seek to promote stability and well-
        being in the North Atlantic area. They are resolved to unite their 
        efforts for collective defence and for the preservation of peace and 
        security.'';
Whereas NATO has been the cornerstone of transatlantic security cooperation and 
        an enduring instrument for promoting stability in Europe and throughout 
        the world for over 60 years;
Whereas the NATO summit in Chicago, Illinois, is an opportunity to enhance and 
        more deeply entrench those principles, which continue to bind the 
        alliance together and guide our efforts today;
Whereas the new Strategic Concept, approved in Lisbon, Portugal in November 
        2010, affirms that all NATO members ``are determined that NATO will 
        continue to play its unique and essential role in ensuring our common 
        defence and security'' and that NATO ``continues to be effective in a 
        changing world, against new threats, with new capabilities and new 
        partners'';
Whereas the Chicago Summit will mark a critical turning point for NATO and a 
        chance to focus on current operations, future capabilities, and the 
        relationship between NATO and partners around the world;
Whereas the Chicago Summit will be the first NATO summit held in the United 
        States since the 50th anniversary summit was held in Washington, 
        District of Columbia, in 1999 and the first NATO summit held outside of 
        Washington, District of Columbia;
Whereas NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said, ``Chicago is a city 
        built upon diversity, and on determination. Those are values that 
        underpin NATO too.'';
Whereas the Chicago Summit presents an opportunity to show to the world the 
        Heartland of the United States--the site of the first elevated railway, 
        the first skyscraper in the world, the busiest futures exchange in the 
        world, and the starting point for historic Route 66;
Whereas the thousands of visitors to the Chicago Summit will have the 
        opportunity to enjoy the hospitality of the city of Chicago, the 77 
        distinct neighborhoods in Chicago, and the State of Illinois; and
Whereas the contributions of generations of immigrants have made the city of 
        Chicago and the State of Illinois what they are today and the ancestral 
        homelands of the immigrants now contribute to making NATO the 
        organization it is today: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes the service of the brave men and women who 
        have served to safeguard the freedom and security of the United 
        States and the whole of the transatlantic alliance;
            (2) honors the sacrifices of United States personnel, 
        allies of the North American Treaty Organization (referred to 
        in this resolution as ``NATO''), and partners in Afghanistan;
            (3) remembers the 63 years NATO has served to ensure peace, 
        security, and stability in Europe and throughout the world;
            (4) reaffirms that NATO, through the new Strategic Concept, 
        is oriented for the changing international security environment 
        and the challenges of the future;
            (5) urges all NATO members to take concrete steps to 
        implement the Strategic Concept and to utilize the NATO summit 
        in Chicago, Illinois, to address current NATO operations, 
        future capabilities and burden-sharing issues, and the 
        relationship between NATO and partners around the world;
            (6) conveys appreciation for the steadfast partnership 
        between NATO and the United States; and
            (7) expresses support for the 2012 NATO summit in Chicago.
                                 <all>
