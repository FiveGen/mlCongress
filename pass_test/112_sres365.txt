                               RESOLUTION


 
     Honoring the life of Kevin Hagan White, the Mayor of Boston, 
                    Massachusetts from 1968 to 1984.

Whereas Kevin White was born in Boston on September 25, 1929;
Whereas his father, Joseph C. White, a legislator of the Commonwealth of 
        Massachusetts; his maternal grandfather, Henry E. Hagan; and his father-
        in-law, William Galvin; each served as presidents of the Boston City 
        Council;
Whereas Kevin White earned a bachelor's degree from Williams College in 1952, a 
        law degree from Boston College in 1955, and also studied at the Harvard 
        Graduate School of Public Administration, now the John F. Kennedy School 
        of Government;
Whereas in 1956, Kevin White married Kathryn Galvin;
Whereas in 1960, at the age of 31, Kevin White was elected Secretary of the 
        Commonwealth of Massachusetts and was reelected 3 times, serving until 
        1967;
Whereas in January 1968, Kevin White became the 51st Mayor of the City of 
        Boston, Massachusetts;
Whereas within months after taking office as Mayor of Boston, Kevin White was 
        instrumental in helping guide the City of Boston after the assassination 
        of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.;
Whereas on April 5, 1968, Mayor White asked that the James Brown concert at the 
        Boston Garden be televised rather than be cancelled, as many suggested;
Whereas during the concert, Mayor White addressed the citizens to plead for calm 
        and said, ``Twenty four hours ago Dr. King died for all of us, black and 
        white, that we may live together in harmony without violence, and in 
        peace. I'm here to ask for your help and to ask you to stay with me as 
        your mayor, and to make Dr. King's dream a reality in Boston. No matter 
        what any other community might do, we in Boston will honor Dr. King in 
        peace.'';
Whereas during his time as Mayor of Boston, Kevin White undertook a program of 
        urban revitalization of the downtown areas of Boston that forever 
        transformed Faneuil Hall and Quincy Market;
Whereas during his time as Mayor, Kevin White brought the residents of each 
        neighborhood of Boston, from Mattapan to Charlestown, from South Boston 
        to Brighton, from East Boston to West Roxbury, together through programs 
        like Summerthing, Little City Halls, and jobs for at-risk youth;
Whereas in 1974, Judge W. Arthur Garrity Jr. of the United States District Court 
        for the District of Massachusetts ordered Boston to begin busing 
        children to integrate its schools;
Whereas during a difficult period of racial tension for the City of Boston, 
        Mayor White urged the people of Boston to remember their common 
        identity;
Whereas from 1984 to 2002, Kevin White was the director of the Institute for 
        Political Communication at Boston University;
Whereas Mayor White valiantly fought against Alzheimer's disease after his 
        diagnosis in 2003 and despite this debilitating challenge, he never 
        stopped being an example of strength for the City of Boston and his 
        family;
Whereas Kevin White is survived by his wife, Kathryn; a brother, Terrence, who 
        managed his early campaigns; his sons, Mark and Chris; his daughters, 
        Caitlin, Beth, and Patricia; his 7 grandchildren; and his sister, 
        Maureen Mercier;
Whereas the most famous campaign slogan coined Kevin White, ``A loner in love 
        with the city''; and
Whereas the irony of the slogan is that Kevin White was never lonely and that 
        the people of Boston who he loved so much, loved him back: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That--
            (1) the Senate--
                    (A) recognizes that Kevin White forever enriched 
                the Boston political landscape and forged a new path 
                for the City of Boston;
                    (B) pays tribute to the work by Kevin White to 
                improve the lives of the residents of the City of 
                Boston; and
                    (C) requests the Secretary of the Senate to prepare 
                an official copy of this resolution for presentation to 
                the family of Kevin White; and
            (2) when the Senate adjourns today, it stand adjourned as a 
        mark of respect to the memory of former Boston Mayor Kevin 
        Hagan White.
