                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing support for the designation of May 2012 as National Youth 
                         Traffic Safety Month.

Whereas motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for youth in the 
        United States;
Whereas thousands of youth are injured or die each year in motor vehicle 
        crashes;
Whereas on average, 11 youths die each day in motor vehicle crashes;
Whereas on average, May through August is the deadliest period for youths on our 
        nation's highways;
Whereas on average, 8 of the top 10 deadliest days for youths on our nation's 
        highways were between May and August;
Whereas events such as prom and graduation, and the summer driving season, 
        contribute to the risk of a motor vehicle crash due to an increase in 
        the amount of time youth spend on the road and in celebratory 
        activities;
Whereas it is essential to teach our youths that driving is a privilege and with 
        that privilege comes risks and responsibilities;
Whereas this education is essential to preventing risky behaviors that can 
        result in tragic crashes;
Whereas the National Organizations For Youth Safety (NOYS) established a 
        national youth campaign and National Youth Traffic Safety Month to draw 
        attention to the increased rate of motor vehicle crashes involving youth 
        between May and August, to help enforce youth safe driving laws, and to 
        support youth and community education on youth traffic safety; and
Whereas NOYS invites all youths, families, and communities to participate in 
        National Youth Traffic Safety Month:
Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) expresses support for the designation of May 2012 as 
        ``National Youth Traffic Safety Month'';
            (2) supports youth traffic safety awareness; and
            (3) encourages people across the United States to observe 
        National Youth Traffic Safety Month with appropriate programs, 
        activities, and ceremonies.
                                 <all>
