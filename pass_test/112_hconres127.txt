  Expressing the sense of Congress regarding actions to preserve and 
advance the multistakeholder governance model under which the Internet 
                              has thrived.

Whereas given the importance of the Internet to the global economy, it is 
        essential that the Internet remain stable, secure, and free from 
        government control;
Whereas the world deserves the access to knowledge, services, commerce, and 
        communication, the accompanying benefits to economic development, 
        education, and

              

 health care, and the informed discussion that is the bedrock of democratic 
self-government that the Internet provides;

Whereas the structure of Internet governance has profound implications for 
        competition and trade, democratization, free expression, and access to 
        information;
Whereas countries have obligations to protect human rights, which are advanced 
        by online activity as well as offline activity;
Whereas the ability to innovate, develop technical capacity, grasp economic 
        opportunities, and promote freedom of expression online is best realized 
        in cooperation with all stakeholders;
Whereas proposals have been put forward for consideration at the 2012 World 
        Conference on International Telecommunications that would fundamentally 
        alter the governance and operation of the Internet;
Whereas the proposals, in international bodies such as the United Nations 
        General Assembly, the United Nations Commission on Science and 
        Technology for Development, and the International Telecommunication 
        Union, would justify under international law increased government 
        control over the Internet and would reject the current multistakeholder 
        model that has enabled the Internet to flourish and under which the 
        private sector, civil society, academia, and individual users play an 
        important role in charting its direction;
Whereas the proposals would diminish the freedom of expression on the Internet 
        in favor of government control over content, contrary to international 
        law;
Whereas the position of the United States Government has been and is to advocate 
        for the flow of information free from government control; and
Whereas this and past Administrations have made a strong commitment to the 
        multistakeholder model of Internet governance and the promotion of the 
        global benefits of the Internet: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That it is the sense of Congress that the Assistant Secretary of 
Commerce for Communications and Information, in consultation with the 
Deputy Assistant Secretary of State and United States Coordinator for 
International Communications and Information Policy, should continue 
working to implement the position of the United States on Internet 
governance that clearly articulates the consistent and unequivocal 
policy of the United States to promote a global Internet free from 
government control and preserve and advance the successful 
multistakeholder model that governs the Internet today.

            Passed the House of Representatives August 2, 2012.

            Attest:

                                                 KAREN L. HAAS,

                                                                 Clerk.
