                               RESOLUTION


 
         To authorize legal representation in Bilbrey v. Tyler.

Whereas, in the case of Bilbrey v. Tyler, No. 18C04-1111-SC-2209, pending in 
        Delaware Circuit Court No. 4, Small Claims Division, in Muncie, Indiana, 
        the plaintiff has sought testimony from former Senator Evan Bayh and an 
        unnamed employee of his former Senate office;
Whereas, pursuant to sections 703(a) and 704(a)(2) of the Ethics in Government 
        Act of 1978, 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 288b(a) and 288c(a)(2), the Senate may 
        direct its counsel to represent former Members and former employees of 
        the Senate with respect to any subpoena, order, or request for testimony 
        relating to their official responsibilities;
Whereas, by the privileges of the Senate of the United States and Rule XI of the 
        Standing Rules of the Senate, no evidence under the control or in the 
        possession of the Senate may, by the judicial or administrative process, 
        be taken from such control or possession but by permission of the 
        Senate;
Whereas, when it appears that evidence under the control or in the possession of 
        the Senate may promote the administration of justice, the Senate will 
        take such action as will promote the ends of justice consistent with the 
        privileges of the Senate: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate Legal Counsel is authorized to represent 
Senator Bayh and former employees of his Senate office in Bilbrey v. 
Tyler and related proceedings.
    Sec. 2.  Senator Bayh's former director of constituent services, 
Karen Railing, is authorized to submit a declaration in this case.
                                 <all>
