the following:
    ``(d)(1) The Secretary may exchange any land or interest in land 
within the boundaries of the park for any land or interest in land 
owned by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the city of Lowell, or the 
University of Massachusetts Building Authority.
    ``(2) Except as provided in paragraph (3), an exchange under this 
subsection shall be subject to the laws, regulations, and policies 
applicable to exchanges of land administered by the National Park 
Service and any other terms and conditions that the Secretary 
determines to be necessary to protect the interests of the United

management and operation of the Lowell National Historical Park exists 
on the Federal land to be exchanged, and the non-Federal land or 
interest in land to be exchanged is not of equal value, the values 
shall be equalized by the payment of cash to the Secretary. The 
Secretary shall not be required to equalize the values of any exchange 
conducted under this subsection if the land or interest in land 
received by the Federal Government exceeds the value of the Federal 
land or interest in land exchanged.''.
