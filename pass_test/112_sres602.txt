                               RESOLUTION


 
  Designating 2012-2013 as the ``Year of the Korean War Veteran'' and 
          recognizing the 60th anniversary of the Korean War.

Whereas, on June 25, 1950, the Communist Democratic People's Republic of Korea 
        began the Korean War by invading the Republic of Korea with 
        approximately 135,000 troops;
Whereas nearly 1,800,000 members of the United States Armed Forces served along 
        with the forces of the Republic of Korea and 20 other Allied nations in 
        the Korean theater of operations to defend freedom and democracy in the 
        Korean Peninsula;
Whereas, during the Korean War, 36,574 people from the United States died and 
        103,284 people from the United States were wounded in some of the most 
        horrific combat and weather conditions in the history of warfare;
Whereas almost 60 years have passed since the signing of the cease-fire 
        agreement at Panmunjom on July 27, 1953, and the Korean Peninsula still 
        technically remains in a state of war;
Whereas the Korean War has for many years been a ``Forgotten War'' for people in 
        the United States;
Whereas Korean War veterans deserve to be recognized by the people of the United 
        States for their honorable and courageous service in defense of 
        democracy and freedom during the Korean War;
Whereas the tide of communism on the southern \1/2\ of the Korean Peninsula was 
        halted, liberty triumphed over tyranny, and the Republic of Korea has 
        developed into a modern and prosperous democracy because of the selfless 
        sacrifice of the Korean War veterans;
Whereas the people of the United States and the Republic of Korea are eternally 
        grateful to the Korean War veterans;
Whereas the history of the Korean War should be included in the curriculum of 
        schools in the United States so that future generations never forget the 
        sacrifices of the Korean War veterans and what those veterans 
        accomplished;
Whereas the Department of Defense 60th Anniversary of the Korean War 
        Commemoration Committee will implement a national campaign to honor the 
        Korean War veterans, remember those Korean War veterans still counted 
        among the missing in action, and educate the people of the United States 
        concerning the ongoing relevance of the Korean War; and
Whereas the commemorative campaign will include ceremonies in the United States 
        and the Republic of Korea in recognition of the beginning (June 25, 
        1950) and the armistice ending hostilities (July 27, 1953), as well as a 
        national media and outreach campaign for Veterans Day 2012 to honor the 
        Korean War veterans: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates 2012-2013 as the ``Year of the Korean War 
        Veteran'';
            (2) recognizes the 60th anniversary of the Korean War; and
            (3) honors the contributions and sacrifices made by the 
        Korean War veterans.
                                 <all>
