                                 AN ACT


 
     To require a Government Accountability Office examination of 
   transactions between large financial institutions and the Federal 
                  Government, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE STUDY OF TRANSACTIONS 
              BETWEEN LARGE FINANCIAL COMPANIES AND THE FEDERAL 
              GOVERNMENT.

    (a) Definitions.--For purposes of this Act--
            (1) the term ``covered institution'' means any bank holding 
        company having more than $500,000,000,000 in consolidated 
        assets; and
            (2) the term ``economic benefit'' means the difference 
        between actual loans terms offered, debt or equity prices, or 
        asset values and a reasonable estimate of what such terms, 
        prices, or values might have been, as determined by examining 
        actual values of comparable transaction in the private markets 
        or by estimating the values of comparable transactions priced 
        to properly reflect associated risk.
    (b) GAO Study.--The Comptroller General of the United States (in 
this section referred to as the ``Comptroller'') shall conduct a study 
of covered institutions, such as--
            (1) the favorable pricing of the debt of such institutions, 
        relative to their risk profile resulting from the perception 
        that such institutions will receive Government support in the 
        event of any financial stress;
            (2) any favorable funding or economic treatment resulting 
        from an increase in the credit rating for covered institutions, 
        as a result of express, implied, or perceived Government 
        support;
            (3) any economic benefit to covered institutions resulting 
        from the ownership of, or affiliation with, an insured 
        depository institution;
            (4) any economic benefit resulting from the status of 
        covered institutions as a bank holding company, including 
        access to Federal deposit insurance and the discount window of 
        the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System before the 
        date of enactment of this Act;
            (5) any economic benefit received through extraordinary 
        Government actions taken, such as--
                    (A) actions by the Department of the Treasury--
                            (i) under the Emergency Economic 
                        Stabilization Act, such as--
                                    (I) asset purchases by the United 
                                States Government;
                                    (II) capital injections from the 
                                United States Government; or
                                    (III) housing programs; or
                            (ii) by the purchase of the mortgage backed 
                        securities of the Federal National Mortgage 
                        Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage 
                        Corporation (in this Act referred to as 
                        ``government-sponsored enterprises''), in order 
                        to lower interest rates, and the value of such 
                        securities in the absence of such purchases;
                    (B) actions by the Board of Governors of the 
                Federal Reserve System prior to the date of enactment 
                of this Act, such as--
                            (i) providing loans to financial
