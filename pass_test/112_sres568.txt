   Designating the week beginning September 16, 2012, as ``National 
                 Hispanic-Serving Institutions Week''.

Whereas Hispanic-serving institutions play an important role in educating many 
        underprivileged students and helping those students attain their full 
        potential through higher education;
Whereas Hispanic-serving institutions are degree-granting institutions that have 
        a full-time equivalent undergraduate enrollment of at least 25 percent 
        Hispanic students;
Whereas there are more than 300 Hispanic-serving institutions in operation in 
        the United States;
Whereas Hispanic-serving institutions serve more than half (54 percent) of all 
        Hispanic students, enrolling more than 1,300,000 students in 2010;
Whereas Hispanic-serving institutions are actively involved in stabilizing and 
        improving the communities in which the Hispanic-serving institutions are 
        located;
Whereas celebrating the vast contributions of Hispanic-serving institutions to 
        the United States strengthens the culture of the United States; and
Whereas the achievements and goals of Hispanic-serving institutions are 
        deserving of national recognition: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes the achievements and goals of Hispanic-
        serving institutions across the United States;
            (2) designates the week beginning September 16, 2012, as 
        ``National Hispanic-Serving Institutions Week''; and
            (3) calls on the people of the United States and interested 
        groups to observe the week with appropriate ceremonies, 
        activities, and programs to demonstrate support for Hispanic-
        serving institutions.
