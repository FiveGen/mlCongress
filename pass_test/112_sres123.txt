Commending ACHIEVA on its 60th anniversary of providing strong advocacy 
 for and innovative services to children and adults with disabilities 
     and the families of those children and adults in the State of 
  Pennsylvania and designating the week of March 26 through April 2,

Whereas ACHIEVA, formerly known as Arc Allegheny, is the premier provider of 
        lifelong support and advocacy services for children and adults with 
        disabilities and the families of those children and adults in Western 
        Pennsylvania;
Whereas more than 10,000 children and adults with disabilities and the families 
        of those children and adults rely on ACHIEVA to provide early 
        intervention, family support, advocacy, respite, vocational, 
        recreational, residential, protective, and future planning services;
Whereas the innovative services provided by ACHIEVA have been featured as models 
        and best practices by State, local, and national media and have been 
        replicated nationally and internationally;
Whereas the traditional family values espoused by ACHIEVA coupled with the best 
        practice services provided by ACHIEVA propel ACHIEVA to the top tier of 
        organizations providing support for people with disabilities;
Whereas ACHIEVA has been the leader in Western Pennsylvania in advocating for 
        and protecting the rights of children and adults with disabilities;
Whereas family members of children with disabilities founded ACHIEVA in 1951 as 
        a means of protecting the rights of their sons and daughters to live 
        fulfilling and inclusive lives in their respective communities;
Whereas the dreams of the founders of ACHIEVA continue to provide the focused 
        mission and vision that drive all of the work ACHIEVA carries out on 
        behalf of its constituents; and
Whereas the dedicated volunteers who have provided organizational leadership to 
        ACHIEVA and the dedicated staff members of ACHIEVA who support children 
        and adults with disabilities and the families of those children and 
        adults also deserve to be honored on the 60th Anniversary of ACHIEVA: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) commends ACHIEVA on its 60th anniversary of providing 
        strong advocacy for and innovative services to children and 
        adults with disabilities and the families of those children and 
        adults in the State of Pennsylvania; and
            (2) designates the week of March 26 through April 2, 2011, 
        as ``Celebrating ACHIEVA's 60th Anniversary Week''.
