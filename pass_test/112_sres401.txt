                               RESOLUTION


 
     Expressing appreciation for Foreign Service and Civil Service 
    professionals who represent the United States around the globe.

Whereas the United States Foreign Service was established by Congress in 1924 to 
        professionalize the country's diplomatic and consular services and 
        advance freedom, democracy, and security for the benefit of the people 
        of the United States and the international community;
Whereas the United States Agency for International Development was established 
        in 1961 to support the foreign policy goals of the United States through 
        economic, development, and humanitarian assistance;
Whereas the Department of State and the United States Agency for International 
        Development together employ more than 27,000 United States nationals in 
        the Foreign Service and Civil Service dedicated to promoting United 
        States interests around the world;
Whereas Foreign Service personnel deploy to Asia, Africa, the Americas, 
        Australia, Europe, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia on a permanent, 
        rotating basis to defend and promote United States priorities abroad;
Whereas many Foreign Service employees spend months or years away from families 
        and loved ones on assignment to dangerous or inhospitable posts where 
        family members are not permitted;
Whereas numerous Department of State and United States Agency for International 
        Development employees have lost their lives while serving abroad;
Whereas strong and purposeful United States diplomacy and development, carried 
        out by a diverse, professionally educated, and well-trained force of 
        Foreign Service and Civil Service professionals, are the most cost-
        effective means to protect and advance United States interests abroad;
Whereas the promotion of commercial engagement by United States businesses in 
        foreign markets and targeted international development projects support 
        economic prosperity, job creation, and opportunities for United States 
        business and industry;
Whereas United States diplomats are often the first line of defense against 
        international conflict and transnational security threats;
Whereas Foreign Service and Civil Service professionals have worked to support 
        the members of the United States Armed Forces involved in critical 
        national security missions and military engagements in dangerous and 
        unstable regions;
Whereas Foreign Service and Civil Service professionals administer emergency 
        assistance in crisis situations; and
Whereas the contributions of Foreign Service and Civil Service professionals to 
        the global advancement of international understanding, American ideals, 
        and the promotion of freedom and democracy around the world should be 
        commended: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes and gives special appreciation to the 
        Foreign Service and Civil Service personnel of the Department 
        of State, the United States Agency for International 
        Development, and other United States Government agencies that 
        promote and protect United State priorities abroad; and
            (2) owes a debt of gratitude to these individuals, and 
        their families, who put public service and pride in their 
        country ahead of comfort, convenience, and even safety in 
        service to the United States and the global community.
                                 <all>
