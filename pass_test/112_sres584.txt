                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

           September 22 (legislative day, September 21), 2012

Mrs. Murray (for herself, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Begich, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Brown 
 of Massachusetts, Mr. Wicker, Mr. Bennet, and Mr. Cochran) submitted 
      the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to

                               RESOLUTION


 
   Designating October 4, 2012, as ``Jumpstart's Read for the Record 
                                 Day''.

Whereas Jumpstart, a national early education organization, is working to ensure 
        that every child in the United States enters school prepared to succeed;
Whereas Jumpstart delivers a year-round research-based and cost-effective 
        program by training college students and community volunteers to serve 
        preschool age children in low-income neighborhoods, helping them to 
        develop the language and literacy skills necessary to succeed in school 
        and in life;
Whereas, since 1993, Jumpstart has trained nearly 25,000 college students and 
        community volunteers to transform the lives of more than 42,000 
        preschool children in communities across the United States;
Whereas Jumpstart's Read for the Record, presented in partnership with the 
        Pearson Foundation, is a national campaign that culminates in one day of 
        the year when millions of people in the United States come together to 
        celebrate literacy and support Jumpstart in its efforts to promote early 
        childhood education;
Whereas the goals of the campaign are to raise awareness in the United States of 
        the importance of early childhood education, support Jumpstart's early 
        education programs in preschools in low-income neighborhoods through 
        donations and sponsorship, and celebrate the commencement of Jumpstart's 
        program year;
Whereas October 4, 2012, is an appropriate date to designate as ``Jumpstart's 
        Read for the Record Day'' because it is the date Jumpstart aims to set 
        the world record for the largest shared reading experience; and
Whereas Jumpstart hopes to engage more than 2,200,000 children in reading 
        ``Ladybug Girl and the Bug Squad'' by David Soman and Jacky Davis during 
        this record-breaking celebration of reading and service, all in support 
        of preschool children in the United States: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates October 4, 2012, as ``Jumpstart's Read for 
        the Record Day'';
            (2) commends Jumpstart's Read for the Record on its seventh 
        year;
            (3) encourages adults, including grandparents, parents, 
        teachers, and college students--
                    (A) to join children in creating the world's 
                largest shared reading experience; and
                    (B) to show their support for literacy and 
                Jumpstart's early education programming for young 
                children in low-income communities; and
            (4) requests the Secretary of the Senate to transmit a copy 
        of this resolution to Jumpstart, one of the leading nonprofit 
        organizations in the United States in the field of early 
        childhood education.
