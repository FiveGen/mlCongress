   Commemorating the 200th anniversary of the chartering of Hamilton 
                     College in Clinton, New York.

Whereas Hamilton College, located in Clinton, New York, received its charter 
        from the Regents of the University of the State of New York on May 26, 
        1812, ``for the instruction and education of youth, in the learned 
        languages and liberal arts and sciences'';
Whereas Hamilton College was originally founded in 1793 as the Hamilton-Oneida 
        Academy by the Reverend Samuel Kirkland, a missionary to the Oneida 
        Indians;
Whereas all-male Hamilton College joined with all-female Kirkland College in 
        1978 to form one coeducational institution of higher learning dedicated 
        to academic freedom and the unfettered pursuit of truth;
Whereas the distinguished alumni of Hamilton College include recipients of the 
        Nobel Peace Prize, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and the Pulitzer 
        Prize, and public servants at every level, including a former Vice 
        President of the United States, United States Senators and 
        Representatives, United States district and appellate court judges, 
        members of the Presidential Cabinet, ambassadors, Governors, and State, 
        county, and local officials; and
Whereas Hamilton College is currently comprised of 1,812 students from 49 states 
        and 37 countries, and a faculty dedicated to teaching and the discovery 
        and advancement of new knowledge: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) commemorates the bicentennial of the chartering of 
        Hamilton College in Clinton, New York; and
            (2) honors the outstanding contributions made by the 
        alumni, faculty, and students of Hamilton College during the 
        past 200 years, including service to the United States that has 
        fostered the development of the United States as a diplomatic 
        force and industrial power in the world.
                                 <all>
