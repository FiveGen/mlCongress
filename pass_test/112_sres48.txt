                               RESOLUTION


 
    Congratulating the Green Bay Packers on winning Super Bowl XLV.

Whereas on Sunday, February 6, 2011, the Green Bay Packers defeated the 
        Pittsburgh Steelers with a score of 31 to 25 in Super Bowl XLV, in 
        Arlington, Texas;
Whereas the victory marks the thirteenth championship win for the Green Bay 
        Packers, the most of any team in the history of the National Football 
        League, and the fourth Super Bowl win for the Green Bay Packers;
Whereas the victory brings the Vince Lombardi Trophy, which was named after the 
        legendary Green Bay Packers coach, back to Green Bay, Wisconsin, also 
        known as ``Titletown, U.S.A.'';
Whereas the Green Bay Packers are publicly owned by diehard fans of the team, 
        making the team unique in professional sports;
Whereas the Green Bay Packers are known all over the world for their devoted 
        fans, as demonstrated by the nearly 300 consecutive sellout games at 
        Lambeau Field, the home field of the Green Bay Packers, and a season 
        ticket waiting list that contains more than 80,000 names;
Whereas the Green Bay Packers never trailed an opponent by more than 7 points 
        during the entire 2010-2011 season;
Whereas the Green Bay Packers overcame injuries to multiple players to secure a 
        berth in the playoffs on the final day of the regular season, following 
        must-win games in the final 2 weeks of the season against the New York 
        Giants and the Chicago Bears;
Whereas the Green Bay Packers defeated the top 3 seeded teams in the National 
        Football Conference to advance to the Super Bowl and became only the 
        second 6th-seed to win the Super Bowl;
Whereas the Green Bay Packers won the Super Bowl due to contributions from an 
        excellent offense, led by Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Aaron Rodgers' 
        304-yard, 3-touchdown performance, and a superb defense that forced 3 
        turnovers, including Nick Collins' 37-yard interception return for a 
        touchdown; and
Whereas Head Coach Mike McCarthy, General Manager Ted Thompson, and President 
        Mark Murphy compiled a team that exemplified the hard work, discipline, 
        determination, and humility of Green Bay, Wisconsin, the home city of 
        the Green Bay Packers: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) congratulates the Green Bay Packers on winning Super 
        Bowl XLV; and
            (2) respectfully requests the Secretary of the Senate to 
        transmit an enrolled copy of this resolution to--
                    (A) the Head Coach of the Green Bay Packers, Mike 
                McCarthy;
                    (B) the General Manager of the Green Bay Packers, 
                Ted Thompson; and
                    (C) the President of the Green Bay Packers, Mark 
                Murphy.
                                 <all>
