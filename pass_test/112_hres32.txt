    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) condemns in the strongest possible terms the horrific attack

        Representative Gabrielle Giffords in Tucson, Arizona, on January 8, 
        2011;

            (3) expresses its hope for the rapid and complete recovery of those 
        wounded in the shooting;
            (4) honors the memory of Christina Taylor Green, Dorothy Morris, 
        John Roll, Phyllis Schneck, Dorwan Stoddard, and Gabriel Zimmerman;
            (5) applauds the bravery and quick thinking exhibited by those 
        individuals who prevented the gunman from potentially taking more lives 
        and helped to save those who had been wounded;
            (6) recognizes the service of the first responders who raced to the 
        scene and the health care professionals who tended to the victims once 
        they reached the hospital, whose service and skill saved lives;
            (7) reaffirms the bedrock principle of American democracy and 
        representative government, which is memorialized in the First Amendment 
        of the Constitution and which Representative Gabrielle Giffords herself 
        read in the Hall of the House of Representatives on January 6, 2011, of 
        ``the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the 
        Government for a redress of grievances'';
            (8) stands firm in its belief in a democracy in which all can 
        participate and in which intimidation and threats of violence cannot 
        silence the voices of any American;
            (9) honors the service and leadership of Representative Gabrielle 
        Giffords, a distinguished member of this House, as she courageously 
        fights to recover; and
            (10) when adjourning today, shall do so out of respect to the 
        victims of this attack.
            Attest:
