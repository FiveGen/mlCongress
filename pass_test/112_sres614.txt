        inter-religious collaborations;
Whereas the World Peace Prize is a prestigious award presented by the World 
        Peace Corps Mission that celebrates individuals who have contributed 
        tremendously to peace and enlightenment for humanity;
Whereas past recipients of the World Peace Prize include President Ronald Reagan 
        of the United States, President Abdurrahman Wahid of Indonesia, and 
        President Nakamura of Palau;
Whereas in 2010, the World Peace Prize Awarding Council recognized His Holiness 
        Dorje Chang Buddha III (referred to in this preamble as ``H.H. Dorje 
        Chang Buddha III'') for his devotion to an immensely wide scope of 
        humanitarian activities directed at individuals from different 
        communities throughout the world;
Whereas H.H. Dorje Chang Buddha III has received numerous awards, including the 
        United States Presidential Gold Award, which the Chairman of the 
        President's Advisory Commission on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders 
        presented on behalf of President George W. Bush to H.H. Dorje Chang 
        Buddha III for the outstanding contributions of H.H. Dorje Chang Buddha 
        III to the arts, medicine, ethics, Buddhism, spiritual leadership, and 
        United States society; and
Whereas in 2010, the World Peace Prize Awarding Council also recognized the 
        Honorable Benjamin A. Gilman for being a life-long champion of human 
        rights who has fought world hunger, narcotics abuse, and narcotics
