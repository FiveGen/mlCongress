                               RESOLUTION


 
Designating June 27, 2011, as ``National Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder 
                            Awareness Day''.

Whereas the brave men and women of the United States Armed Forces, who proudly 
        serve the United States, risk their lives to protect the freedom of the 
        United States and deserve the investment of every reasonable resource to 
        ensure their lasting physical, mental, and emotional well-being;
Whereas 2.4 percent of servicemembers returning from deployment to Operation 
        Enduring Freedom or Operation Iraqi Freedom are clinically diagnosed 
        with post-traumatic stress disorder (referred to in this preamble as 
        ``PTSD'') and up to 17 percent of Operation Enduring Freedom and 
        Operation Iraqi Freedom veterans exposed to sustained ground combat 
        report PTSD symptoms;
Whereas up to 10 percent of Operation Desert Storm veterans, 30 percent of 
        Vietnam veterans, and 8 percent of the general population of the United 
        States suffer or have suffered from PTSD;
Whereas the Department of Veterans Affairs reports that more than 438,000 
        veterans were treated for PTSD in 2010 alone;
Whereas many cases of PTSD remain unreported, undiagnosed, and untreated due to 
        a lack of awareness about PTSD and the persistent stigma associated with 
        mental health issues;
Whereas PTSD significantly increases the risk of depression, suicide, and drug- 
        and alcohol-related disorders and deaths, especially if left untreated;
Whereas the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs have made significant 
        advances in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of PTSD and the 
        symptoms of PTSD, but many challenges remain; and
Whereas the establishment of a National Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Awareness 
        Day will raise public awareness about issues related to PTSD and help 
        ensure that those suffering from the invisible wounds of war receive 
        proper treatment: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates June 27, 2011, as ``National Post-Traumatic 
        Stress Disorder Awareness Day'';
            (2) supports the efforts of the Secretary of Veterans 
        Affairs and the Secretary of Defense to educate servicemembers, 
        veterans, the families of servicemembers and veterans, and the 
        public about the causes, symptoms, and treatment of post-
        traumatic stress disorder; and
            (3) respectfully requests that the Secretary of the Senate 
        transmit a copy of this resolution to the Secretary of Veterans 
        Affairs and the Secretary of Defense.
                                 <all>
