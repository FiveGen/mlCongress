                               RESOLUTION


 
   Commemorating the 60th Anniversary of the United States-Australia 
                               alliance.

Whereas the United States Government enhanced its relationship with the 
        Governments of Australia and New Zealand with the signing of the 
        Australia-New Zealand-United States (ANZUS) Treaty on September 1, 1951, 
        and subsequently engaged in annual, bilateral Australian-United States 
        Ministerial (AUSMIN) consultations between the Australian Ministers of 
        Foreign Affairs and Defence and the United States Secretaries of State 
        and Defense, including a meeting in San Francisco in September 2011 that 
        commemorated the 60th anniversary of the United States-Australia 
        alliance;
Whereas the alliance remains fundamental to the security of Australia and the 
        United States and to the peace, stability, and prosperity of the Asia-
        Pacific region, and is one dimension of a broad and deep relationship 
        between the two countries that encompasses robust bilateral strategic, 
        intelligence, trade, and investment relations based on shared interests 
        and values, a common history and cultural traditions, and mutual 
        respect;
Whereas numerous visits by Presidents of the United States, including this week 
        by President Barack Obama, and by the Australian Prime Minister to the 
        United States, including in 2011 when Prime Minister Julia Gillard 
        addressed a Joint Session of Congress, have underscored the strength and 
        closeness of the relationship;
Whereas members of the United States and Australian armed forces have fought 
        side-by-side in every major conflict since the First World War, with the 
        commitment to mutual defense and security between the United States and 
        Australia being longstanding and unshakeable, as was demonstrated by the 
        joint decision to invoke the ANZUS Treaty in the aftermath of the 
        September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks;
Whereas the Governments of the United States and Australia continue to share a 
        common approach to the most pressing issues in global defense and 
        security, including in Afghanistan, where about 1,550 Australian Defence 
        Force personnel are deployed, and in response to natural disasters and 
        humanitarian crises, such as in Japan following the earthquake and 
        subsequent tsunami in March 2011;
Whereas Secretary of State Hillary Clinton recently stated, ``We are expanding 
        our alliance with Australia from a Pacific partnership to an Indo-
        Pacific one, and indeed a global partnership. . .. Australia's counsel 
        and commitment have been indispensable.'';
Whereas Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta recently remarked that ``the United 
        States has no closer ally than Australia. . .. [We] affirm this 
        alliance, affirm that it remains strong, and that we are determined to 
        deepen our security cooperation even further to counter the threats and 
        challenges that we face in the future.'';
Whereas the Governments of the United States and Australia agreed to set up a 
        Force Posture Working Group at the November 2010 AUSMIN to examine 
        options to align respective force postures consistent with the national 
        security requirements of both countries and to help positively shape the 
        regional security environment;
Whereas the United States and Australia committed in a Joint Statement on 
        Cyberspace during the 2011 AUSMIN meeting to consult together and 
        determine appropriate options to address any threats;
Whereas the Government of Australia is a major purchaser of United States 
        military resources, approximately 50 percent of Australia's war-fighting 
        assets are sourced from the United States, and the Government of 
        Australia has plans to spend a substantial sum over the next 10-15 years 
        to update or replace up to about 85 percent of its military equipment;
Whereas, on September 29, 2010, the Senate provided its advice and consent to 
        ratification of the Treaty Between the Government of the United States 
        of America and the Government of Australia Concerning Defense Trade 
        Cooperation, signed at Sydney, Australia, September 5, 2007, which will 
        facilitate defense trade between the two nations and enhance 
        interoperability between military forces;
Whereas the Governments of the United States and Australia support open, 
        transparent, and inclusive regional architectures to preserve and 
        enhance peace, security, and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region;
Whereas the Governments of the United States and Australia cooperate closely in 
        regional and global forums, as evidenced by Australia's support for the 
        United States as the host this month of the Asia-Pacific Economic 
        Cooperation forum in 2011 and the United States' support for Australia 
        to host the G-20 in 2014;
Whereas the United States and Australia elevated their trade relationship 
        through the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement that entered 
        into force on January 1, 2005, and exports of United States goods to 
        Australia have risen by 53 percent since that time, totaling 
        $21,900,000,000 in 2010;
Whereas the United States is Australia's largest destination for foreign 
        investment, helping create jobs for United States workers, with 
        Australian companies employing more than 88,000 people directly in the 
        United States;
Whereas the Governments and people of the United States and Australia work 
        closely to advance and support human rights, the rule of law, and basic 
        freedoms worldwide;
Whereas the Governments and people of the United States and Australia work 
        jointly and separately to support democracy, economic reform, and good 
        governance in the Pacific Islands, Southeast Asia, South and Central 
        Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa, among other areas of the world; 
        and
Whereas the Governments of the United States and Australia are working through 
        their respective aid agencies (USAID and AusAID) and also exploring 
        opportunities for collaboration across a wide variety of areas: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) celebrates the 60th Anniversary of the United States-
        Australia alliance and takes this opportunity to reiterate the 
        enduring significance of this historic friendship that serves 
        as an anchor of peace, stability, and prosperity in the Asia-
        Pacific region and in the world;
            (2) supports United States efforts to strengthen military, 
        diplomatic, trade, economic, and people-to-people cooperation 
        with Australia, including initiatives to positively shape the 
        evolving strategic and economic environment that connects the 
        Indian and the Pacific Oceans; and
            (3) urges close consultation between the Governments of the 
        United States and Australia in preparation for the East Asia 
        Summit to be chaired by Indonesia on November 19, 2011, and 
        encourages other, new forms of cooperation with the Government 
        and people of Australia that strengthen regional architectures 
        to enhance peace, security, and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific 
        region.
