                               RESOLUTION


 
         Designating May 2011, as ``National Inventors Month''.

Whereas the first United States patent was issued in 1790 to Samuel Hopkins of 
        the State of Vermont for a process to make better fertilizer;
Whereas American inventors have contributed to advances in life sciences, 
        technology, and manufacturing;
Whereas the Constitution specifically provides for the granting of exclusive 
        rights to inventors for their discoveries;
Whereas the United States patent system is intended to implement that 
        constitutional imperative and incentivize inventions;
Whereas American inventors benefit from an up-to-date and efficient patent 
        system and the economy, jobs, and consumers of the United States benefit 
        from the inventions;
Whereas the next great American invention could be among the 700,000 patent 
        applications pending as of the date of approval of this resolution in 
        the United States Patent and Trademark Office;
Whereas the last changes to the United States patent system were made nearly 60 
        years ago;
Whereas an updated patent system will unleash innovation and create jobs in the 
        United States without adding to the deficit;
Whereas every May, a new class of inventors is inducted into the National 
        Inventors Hall of Fame;
Whereas in the 112th Congress, a bill was introduced in the House of 
        Representatives entitled the ``America Invents Act'' (H.R. 1249) to make 
        reforms to the United States patent system; and
Whereas the Senate on March 8, 2011, passed the bill entitled the ``America 
        Invents Act'' (S. 23), which will make the first comprehensive reforms 
        to the United States patent system in nearly 60 years: Now, therefore, 
        be it
    Resolved, That the Senate designates May 2011, as ``National 
Inventors Month''.
                                 <all>
