                               RESOLUTION


 
      Supporting the goals and ideals of American Diabetes Month.

Whereas according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (referred to 
        in this preamble as ``CDC''), nearly 26,000,000 people of the United 
        States have diabetes and 79,000,000 people of the United States have 
        pre-diabetes
Whereas diabetes is a serious chronic condition that affects people of every 
        age, race, ethnicity, and income level;
Whereas the CDC reports that Hispanic, African, Asian, and Native Americans are 
        disproportionately affected by diabetes and suffer from diabetes at 
        rates that are much higher than the general population;
Whereas according to the CDC, someone is diagnosed with diabetes every 17 
        seconds;
Whereas each day, approximately 5,082 people are diagnosed with diabetes;
Whereas in 2010, the CDC estimated that approximately 1,900,000 individuals aged 
        20 and older were newly diagnosed with diabetes;
Whereas a joint National Institutes of Health and CDC study found that 
        approximately 15,000 youth in the United States are diagnosed with type 
        1 diabetes annually and approximately 3,600 youth are diagnosed with 
        type 2 diabetes annually;
Whereas according to the CDC, between 1980 and 2007, diabetes prevalence in the 
        United States increased by more than 300 percent;
Whereas the CDC reports that over 27 percent of individuals with diabetes are 
        undiagnosed;
Whereas the National Diabetes Fact Sheet issued by the CDC states that more than 
        11 percent of adults of the United States and 26.9 percent of people of 
        the United States age 60 and older have diabetes;
Whereas the CDC estimates as many as 1 in 3 American adults will have diabetes 
        in 2050 if present trends continue;
Whereas the CDC estimates that as many as 1 in 2 Hispanic, African, Asian, and 
        Native American adults will have diabetes in 2050 if present trends 
        continue;
Whereas according to the American Diabetes Association, in 2007, the total cost 
        of diagnosed diabetes in the United States was $174,000,000,000, and 1 
        in 10 dollars spent on health care was attributed to diabetes and its 
        complications;
Whereas according to a Lewin Group study, in 2007, the total cost of diabetes 
        (including both diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes, pre-diabetes, and 
        gestational diabetes) was $218,000,000,000;
Whereas a Mathematica Policy Research study in 2007 found that, for each fiscal 
        year, total expenditures for Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes 
        comprise 32.7 percent of the Medicare budget;
Whereas according to the CDC, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in 
        2007 and contributed to the deaths of over 230,000 Americans in 2007;
Whereas there is not yet a cure for diabetes;
Whereas there are proven means to reduce the incidence of, and delay the onset 
        of, type 2 diabetes;
Whereas with the proper management and treatment, people with diabetes live 
        healthy, productive lives; and
Whereas American Diabetes Month is celebrated in November: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of American Diabetes 
        Month, including--
                    (A) encouraging the people of the United States to 
                fight diabetes through public awareness about 
                prevention and treatment options; and
                    (B) increasing education about the disease;
            (2) recognizes the importance of early detection of 
        diabetes, awareness of the symptoms of diabetes, and the risk 
        factors that often lead to the development of diabetes, 
        including--
                    (A) being over the age of 45;
                    (B) having a specific racial and ethnic background;

                    (D) having a low level of physical activity level;
                    (E) having high blood pressure; and
                    (F) having a family history of diabetes or a 
                history of diabetes during pregnancy; and
            (3) supports decreasing the prevalence of type 1, type 2, 
        and gestational diabetes in the United States through increased 
        research, treatment, and prevention.
