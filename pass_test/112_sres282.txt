                               RESOLUTION


 
   To authorize testimony in Kanelos v. County of Mohave, et al. and 
                 Zanna, et al. v. Mohave County, et al.

Whereas, in the cases of Kanelos v. County of Mohave, et al., Civ. No. 10-8099 
        (D. Ariz.) and Zanna, et al. v. Mohave County, et al., Civ. No. 10-8149 
        (D. Ariz.), pending in federal district court in Arizona, the defendants 
        have requested that a declaration be submitted by Gina Gormley, an 
        employee of Senator John McCain;
Whereas, by the privileges of the Senate of the United States and Rule XI of the 
        Standing Rules of the Senate, no evidence under the control or in the 
        possession of the Senate may, by the judicial or administrative process, 
        be taken from such control or possession but by permission of the 
        Senate; and
Whereas, when it appears that evidence under the control or in the possession of 
        the Senate may promote the administration of justice, the Senate will 
        take such action as will promote the ends of justice consistent with the 
        privileges of the Senate: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That Gina Gormley is authorized to testify in the cases 
of Kanelos v. County of Mohave, et al. and Zanna, et al. v. Mohave 
County et al., except concerning matters for which a privilege should 
be asserted.
                                 <all>
