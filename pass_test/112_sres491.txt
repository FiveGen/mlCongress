                               RESOLUTION


 
    Commending the participants in the 44th International Chemistry 
 Olympiad and recognizing the importance of education in the fields of 
science, technology, engineering, and mathematics to the future of the 
                             United States.

Whereas the global economy of the future will require a workforce that is 
        educated in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and 
        mathematics (referred to in this preamble as ``STEM'');
Whereas the science of chemistry is vital to the improvement of human life 
        because chemistry has the power to transform;
Whereas chemistry improves human lives by providing critical solutions to global 
        challenges involving safe food, water, transportation, and products, 
        alternate sources of energy, improved health, and a healthy and 
        sustainable environment;
Whereas the International Chemistry Olympiad is an annual competition for the 
        most talented secondary school chemistry students in the world that 
        seeks to stimulate interest in chemistry through creative problem 
        solving;
Whereas the 44th International Chemistry Olympiad will be held at the University 
        of Maryland, College Park from July 21 through 30, 2012;
Whereas more than 70 countries and nearly 300 students will compete in the 44th 
        International Chemistry Olympiad in theoretical and practical 
        examinations covering analytical chemistry, biochemistry, inorganic 
        chemistry, organic chemistry, physical chemistry, and spectroscopy;
Whereas the objective of the International Chemistry Olympiad is to promote 
        international relationships in STEM education (particularly in 
        chemistry), cooperation among students, and the exchange of pedagogical 
        and scientific experience in STEM education;
Whereas STEM education at the secondary school level is critically important to 
        the future of the United States; and
Whereas the students who will compete in the International Chemistry Olympiad 
        deserve recognition and support for their efforts: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) welcomes the 44th International Chemistry Olympiad to 
        the United States;
            (2) recognizes the need to encourage young people to pursue 
        careers in the fields of science (including chemistry), 
        technology, engineering, and mathematics; and
            (3) commends the University of Maryland, College Park for 
        hosting and the American Chemical Society for organizing the 
        44th International Chemistry Olympiad.
                                 <all>
