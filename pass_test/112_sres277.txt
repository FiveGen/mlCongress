                               RESOLUTION


 
Recognizing the month of October 2011 as ``National Principals Month''.

Whereas the National Association of Secondary School Principals and the National 
        Association of Elementary School Principals have declared the month of 
        October 2011 as ``National Principals Month'';
Whereas principals are educational visionaries, instructional and assessment 
        leaders, disciplinarians, community builders, budget analysts, 
        facilities managers, and administrators of legal and contractual 
        obligations;
Whereas principals work collaboratively with teachers and parents to develop and 
        implement a clear mission, high curriculum standards, and performance 
        goals;
Whereas principals create school environments that facilitate great teaching and 
        learning and continuous school improvement;
Whereas the vision, actions, and dedication of principals provide the mobilizing 
        force behind any school reform effort; and
Whereas the celebration of ``National Principals Month'' would honor elementary 
        school, middle school, and high school principals, and recognize the 
        importance of principals in ensuring that every child has access to a 
        high-quality education: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes the month of October 2011 as ``National 
        Principals Month''; and
            (2) honors the contribution of principals in the elementary 
        schools, middle schools, and high schools of our Nation by 
        supporting the goals and ideals of ``National Principals 
        Month''.
                                 <all>
