                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                             March 8, 2012

Mr. Bennet (for himself, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Boozman, Mr. Merkley, and Mr. 
  Hatch) submitted the following resolution; which was considered and 
                               agreed to

                               RESOLUTION


 
         Designating March 11, 2012, as ``World Plumbing Day''.

Whereas the industry of plumbing plays an important role in safeguarding the 
        public health of the people of the United States and the world;
Whereas 884,000,000 people around the world do not have access to safe drinking 
        water;
Whereas 2,600,000,000 people around the world live without adequate sanitation 
        facilities;
Whereas the lack of sanitation is the largest cause of infection in the world;
Whereas in the developing world, 24,000 children under the age of 5 die every 
        day from preventable causes, such as diarrhea contracted from unclean 
        water;
Whereas safe and efficient plumbing helps save money and reduces future water 
        supply costs and infrastructure costs;
Whereas the installation of modern plumbing systems must be accomplished in a 
        specific, safe manner by trained professionals in order to prevent 
        widespread disease, which can be crippling and deadly to the community;
Whereas the people of the United States rely on plumbing professionals to 
        maintain, repair, and rebuild the aging water infrastructure of the 
        United States;
Whereas Congress and plumbing professionals across the United States and the 
        world are committed to safeguarding public health; and
Whereas the founding organization of World Plumbing Day, the World Plumbing 
        Council, is currently being chaired by GP Russ Chaney, a United States 
        citizen: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate designates March 11, 2012, as ``World 
Plumbing Day''.
                                 <all>
