                               RESOLUTION


 
  Recognizing the 100th anniversary of the American Podiatric Medical 
    Association, the preeminent organization representing podiatric 
medicine and surgery, celebrating its achievements, and encouraging the 
  association to continue providing guidance on foot and ankle health 
      issues to the people of the United States and of the world.

Whereas, in 1912, Alfred Joseph was the driving force behind the establishment 
        of the National Association of Chiropodists (referred to as the ``NAC'' 
        in this preamble), an organization dedicated to the needs and 
        educational standards of chiropodists and to advancing and advocating 
        for the profession of podiatric medicine and surgery for the benefit of 
        its members and the public, and was elected the first president of the 
        NAC;
Whereas, by 1922, most States had passed laws regulating the professional 
        practice of chiropody;
Whereas, in 1922, the NAC began publishing the Journal of the National 
        Association of Chiropodists and the NAC's Council on Education began its 
        first college accreditation activities;
Whereas, in 1943, the NAC ran an advertisement campaign in Life magazine 
        highlighting the efforts of podiatrists to keep United States soldiers 
        marching;
Whereas, in 1957, the NAC was renamed the American Podiatry Association 
        (referred to as the ``APA'' in this preamble);
Whereas, in 1959, the APA established the Educational Foundation to advance the 
        growth and stability of podiatric medicine through student scholarships 
        and increased national awareness of foot and ankle health;
Whereas, in 1967, podiatric physicians were included as covered providers under 
        the Medicare program under title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 
        U.S.C. 1395 et seq.);
Whereas, in 1971, all the colleges of podiatric medicine began granting the DPM 
        (doctor of podiatric medicine) degree to students graduating from 4 
        years of podiatric medical training;
Whereas, in 1984, the APA was renamed the American Podiatric Medical Association 
        to emphasize the profession as part of mainstream medical practice;
Whereas, in 2011, the Council on Podiatric Medical Education adopted the 
        requirements of a 3 year podiatric medicine and surgery residency, which 
        was approved for full graduate medical education funding by the Centers 
        for Medicare and Medicaid Services;
Whereas the American Podiatric Medical Association regularly hosts medical and 
        scientific meetings dedicated to highlighting and disseminating research 
        findings and clinical advances in the prevention, detection, treatment, 
        and cure of foot, ankle, and related conditions;
Whereas the American Podiatric Medical Association continues to meet its 
        clinical and scientific mission through the publication of academic 
        journals and clinical statements on the prevention, diagnosis, 
        treatment, and cure of foot and ankle disorders, as well as through the 
        provision of continuing medical education in foot and ankle care and 
        through consumer education on foot and ankle health;
Whereas feet often reveal indicators of overall health, including signs of 
        arthritis, diabetes, and nerve and circulatory disorders;
Whereas medically necessary care provided by podiatrists can reduce the risk of 
        and prevent complications from these conditions and diseases, while at 
        the same time offer savings to the heavily burdened health care system 
        of the United States; and
Whereas the American Podiatric Medical Association has a long tradition of 
        working in collaboration with the Federal Government to improve the foot 
        and ankle health of all people of the United States: Now, therefore, be 
        it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes the scientific, clinical, and public health 
        achievements of the American Podiatric Medical Association as 
        its members and staff commemorate and celebrate its 100th 
        anniversary;
            (2) recognizes the great impact that the American Podiatric 
        Medical Association has had on improving the foot and ankle and 
        related health of people in the United States and around the 
        world; and
            (3) congratulates the American Podiatric Medical 
        Association for its achievements and encourages the 
        organization to continue providing scientific guidance on foot 
        and ankle and related health issues to improve the public 
        health of future generations.
