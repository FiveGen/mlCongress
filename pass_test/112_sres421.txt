Whereas Global Youth Service Day is an annual event that celebrates and 
        mobilizes the millions of children and young people who improve their 
        communities each day of the year through community service and service-
        learning projects;
Whereas Global Youth Service Day, a program of Youth Service America, is the 
        largest and longest-running service event in the world dedicated to 
        engaging youth ages 5 through 25;
Whereas, in 2012, Global Youth Service Day is being observed for the 24th 
        consecutive year in the United States and for the 13th year globally in 
        more than 100 countries;
Whereas nearly \1/3\ of the population of the United States (approximately 
        104,000,000 people) and nearly \1/2\ of population of the world is under 
        the age of 25;
Whereas Global Youth Service Day assists children and young people to position 
        themselves as active citizens and community leaders as they apply their 
        knowledge, skills, idealism, energy, creativity, and unique perspectives 
        to serve their communities and help address a myriad of critical issues;
Whereas thousands of students and teachers in conjunction with local schools, 
        colleges, and universities are planning Global Youth Service Day 
        activities as part of a Semester of Service, an extended service-
        learning campaign launched on Martin Luther King, Jr. Day of Service, in 
        which young people spend the semester addressing a meaningful community 
        need connected to intentional learning goals or academic standards over 
        the course of not less than 70 hours;
Whereas Global Youth Service Day participants are serving in conjunction with

        businesses, neighborhood associations, tribes, and families;

        Lead Organizer, and School Engagement grants, Disney Friends for Change 
        grants, and Learn and Serve America STEMester of Service grants;
Whereas, in 2011, youth volunteers who engaged in Global Youth Service Day 
        projects served an estimated 1,417,000 hours of service that benefitted 
        at least 885,000 individuals and contributed $30,267,120 worth of time 
        to their communities;

        calls on the Corporation for National and Community Service, other 
        Federal agencies and departments, and the President of the United States 
        to recognize and support youth-led activities: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes and commends the significant contributions 
        of young people of the United States and the world and 
        encourages the continued engagement and support of young people 
        dedicated to serving their neighbors, their communities, and 
        their countries;
            (2) designates April 20 through 22, 2012, as ``Global Youth 
        Service Day''; and
            (3) calls on the people of the United States to observe 
        Global Youth Service Day by--
                    (A) encouraging young people to participate in 
                community service and service-learning projects and to 
                join their peers in those projects;
                    (B) recognizing the volunteer efforts of the young 
                people of the United States throughout the year; and
                    (C) supporting the volunteer efforts of young 
                people and engaging them in meaningful community 
                service, service-learning, and decision-making 
                opportunities as an investment in the future of the 
                United States.
