                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                           February 17, 2011

    Mr. Brown of Ohio (for himself and Mr. Barrasso) submitted the 
        following resolution; which was considered and agreed to

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
         Designates February 28, 2011, as ``Rare Disease Day''.

Whereas rare diseases and disorders are those which affect small patient 
        populations, typically populations smaller than 200,000 individuals in 
        the United States;
Whereas as of the date of approval of this resolution, nearly 7,000 rare 
        diseases affect 30,000,000 Americans and their families;
Whereas children with rare genetic diseases account for more than half of the 
        population affected by rare diseases in the United States;
Whereas many rare diseases are serious, life-threatening, and lack an effective 
        treatment;
Whereas rare diseases and conditions include epidermolysis bullosa, progeria, 
        sickle cell anemia, Tay-Sachs, cystic fibrosis, many childhood cancers, 
        and fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva;
Whereas people with rare diseases experience challenges that include difficulty 
        in obtaining an accurate diagnosis, limited treatment options, and 
        difficulty finding physicians or treatment centers with expertise in 
        their disease;
Whereas great strides have been made in research and treatment for rare diseases 
        as a result of the Orphan Drug Act (Public Law 97-414; 96 Stat. 2049) 
        and amendments made by that Act;
Whereas both the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of 
        Health have established special offices to advocate for rare disease 
        research and treatments;
Whereas the National Organization for Rare Disorders, an organization 
        established in 1983 to provide services to, and advocate on behalf of, 
        patients with rare diseases, was a primary force behind the enactment of 
        the Orphan Drug Act and remains a critical public voice for people with 
        rare diseases;
Whereas the National Organization for Rare Disorders sponsors Rare Disease Day 
        in the United States to increase public awareness of rare diseases;
Whereas Rare Disease Day has become a global event occurring annually on the 
        last day of February;
Whereas Rare Disease Day was observed in the United States for the first time on 
        February 28, 2009; and
Whereas Rare Disease Day is anticipated to be observed globally in years to 
        come, providing hope and information for rare disease patients around 
        the world; Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates February 28, 2011, as ``Rare Disease Day'';
            (2) recognizes the importance of improving awareness and 
        encouraging accurate and early diagnosis of rare diseases and 
        disorders; and
            (3) supports a national and global commitment to improving 
        access to, and developing new treatments, diagnostics, and 
        cures for, rare diseases and disorders.
                                 <all>
