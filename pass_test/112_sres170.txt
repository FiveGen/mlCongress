                               RESOLUTION


 
Honoring Admiral Thad Allen of the United States Coast Guard (Ret.) for 
his lifetime of selfless commitment and exemplary service to the United 
                                States.

Whereas Admiral Thad Allen, the 23rd Commandant of the United States Coast 
        Guard, retired from the Coast Guard on June 30, 2010, after 39 
        distinguished years of service;
Whereas Admiral Allen graduated from the United States Coast Guard Academy in 
        1971 and served in a number of capacities, including serving as the 
        Principal Federal Official for response and recovery operation for 
        Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, Coast Guard Chief of Staff, and most 
        recently as National Incident Commander for the Deepwater Horizon 
        Disaster in the Gulf of Mexico;
Whereas Admiral Allen commanded with distinction the foremost Coast Guard in the 
        world from 2006 to 2010 and has embodied the Coast Guard's enduring 
        values of honor, respect, and devotion to duty;
Whereas Admiral Allen, during his tenure as Commandant, focused the Coast Guard 
        on modernization and improved readiness in responding to natural 
        disasters;
Whereas Admiral Allen, during his tenure as Commandant, worked to ensure the 
        safety of professional mariners and millions of recreational and 
        commercial vessels, facilitate commerce, protect the ports and maritime 
        infrastructure of the United States from terrorism, conduct humanitarian 
        operations, protect our marine environment, secure United States 
        borders, combat drug trafficking, support anti-piracy efforts, and 
        support Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom;
Whereas Admiral Allen demonstrated the vision and transformational leadership 
        that will provide the United States with a Coast Guard that is not only 
        capable of meeting and exceeding the ever-changing maritime challenges 
        of the United States, but also able to better anticipate future 
        challenges and missions;
Whereas Admiral Allen provided steady leadership in times of crisis;
Whereas as Dwight Eisenhower, the 34th President of the United States once said, 
        ``The qualities of a great man are vision, integrity, courage, 
        understanding, the power of articulation, and profundity of character''; 
        and
Whereas as we bid fair winds and following seas to Admiral Allen, it is 
        appropriate that he be remembered as exemplifying such trademark 
        characteristics exhibited by great leaders: Now therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
     (a) recognizes and honors Admiral Thad Allen of the United States 
Coast Guard (retired), on behalf of a grateful Nation, for his lifetime 
of selfless commitment and exemplary service; and
    (b) directs the Secretary of the Senate to transmit an enrolled 
copy of this resolution to Admiral Thad Allen.
                                 <all>
