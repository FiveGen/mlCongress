 Recognizing and honoring the zoos and aquariums of the United States.

Whereas the 223 zoos and aquariums accredited by the Association of Zoos and 
        Aquariums support more than 142,000 jobs nationwide, making such zoos 
        and aquariums a valuable part of local and national economies;
Whereas according to the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, accredited zoos and 
        aquariums generate more than $15,000,000,000 in economic activity in the 
        United States annually;
Whereas according to the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, accredited zoos and 
        aquariums attract more than 165,000,000 visitors each year and are a 
        valuable part of regional, State, and local tourist economies;
Whereas according to the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, accredited zoos and 
        aquariums have formally trained more than 400,000 teachers, and such 
        zoos and aquariums support science curricula with effective teaching 
        materials and hands-on opportunities and host more than 12,000,000 
        students annually on school field trips;
Whereas according to the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, accredited zoos and 
        aquariums provide a unique opportunity for the public to engage in 
        conservation and education efforts, and more than 60,000 people invest 
        more than 3,000,000 hours per year as volunteers at such zoos and 
        aquariums;
Whereas public investment in accredited zoos and aquariums has dual benefits, 
        including immediate job creation and environmental education for 
        children in the United States;
Whereas accredited zoos and aquariums focus on connecting people and animals, 
        and such zoos and aquariums provide a critical link to helping animals 
        in their native habitats;
Whereas according to the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, accredited zoos and 
        aquariums have provided more than $90,000,000 per year over the past 5 
        years to support more than 4,000 field conservation and research 
        projects in more than 100 countries; and
Whereas many Federal agencies have recognized accredited zoos and aquariums as 
        critical partners in rescue, rehabilitation, confiscation, and 
        reintroduction efforts for distressed, threatened, and endangered 
        species: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--

        United States;
            (2) commends the employees and volunteers at each zoo and 
        aquarium for their hard work and dedication;
            (3) recommends that people in the United States visit their

        educational opportunities that such zoos and aquariums offer; 
        and
            (4) urges continued support for accredited zoos and 
        aquariums and the important conservation, education, and 
        recreation programs of such zoos and aquariums.
