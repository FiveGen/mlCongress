                               RESOLUTION


 
   Recognizing National Foster Care Month as an opportunity to raise 
  awareness about the challenges faced by children in the foster care 
system, acknowledging the dedication of foster care parents, advocates, 
 and workers, and encouraging Congress to implement policy to improve 
            the lives of children in the foster care system.

Whereas National Foster Care Month was established more than 20 years ago to 
        bring foster care issues to the forefront, highlight the importance of 
        permanency for every child, and recognize the essential role that foster 
        parents, social workers, and advocates have in the lives of children in 
        foster care throughout the United States;
Whereas all children deserve a safe, loving, and permanent home;
Whereas the primary goal of the foster care system is to ensure the safety and 
        well-being of children while working to provide a safe, loving, and 
        permanent home for each child;
Whereas there are approximately 408,000 children living in foster care;
Whereas there were approximately 254,000 youth that entered the foster care 
        system in 2010, while over 107,000 youth were eligible and awaiting 
        adoption at the end of 2010;
Whereas children in foster care experience an average of 3 different placements, 
        which often leads to disruption of routines and the need to change 
        schools and move away from siblings, extended families, and familiar 
        surroundings;
Whereas youth in foster care are much more likely to face educational 
        instability with 65 percent of former foster children experiencing at 
        least 7 school changes while in care;
Whereas children of color are more likely to stay in the foster care system for 
        longer periods of time and are less likely to be reunited with their 
        biological families;
Whereas foster parents are the front-line caregivers for children who cannot 
        safely remain with their biological parents and provide physical care, 
        emotional support, education advocacy, and are the largest single source 
        of families providing permanent homes for children leaving foster care 
        to adoption;
Whereas children in foster care who are placed with relatives, compared to 
        children placed with nonrelatives, have more stability, including fewer 
        changes in placements, have more positive perceptions of their 
        placements, are more likely to be placed with their siblings, and 
        demonstrate fewer behavioral problems;
Whereas an increased emphasis on prevention and reunification services is 
        necessary to reduce the number of children that are forced to remain in 
        the foster care system;
Whereas more than 27,900 youth ``age out'' of foster care without a legal 
        permanent connection to an adult or family;
Whereas children who age out of foster care may lack the security or support of 
        a biological or adoptive family and frequently struggle to secure 
        affordable housing, obtain health insurance, pursue higher education, 
        and acquire adequate employment;
Whereas foster care is intended to be a temporary placement, but children remain 
        in the foster care system for an average of 2 years;
Whereas volunteers, guardians, mentors, and workers in the child-protective-
        services community play a vital role in improving the safety of the most 
        valuable youth and work hard to increase permanency through 
        reunification, adoption, and guardianship;
Whereas due to heavy caseloads and limited resources, the average tenure for a 
        worker in child protection services is just 3 years;
Whereas on average, 8.5 percent of the positions in child protective services 
        remain vacant;
Whereas States, localities, and communities should be encouraged to invest 
        resources in preventative and reunification services and postpermanency 
        programs to ensure that more children in foster care are provided with 
        safe, loving, and permanent placements;
Whereas Federal legislation over the past 3 decades, including the Adoption 
        Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 (Public Law 96-272), the 
        Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 (Public Law 105-89), the 
        Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 
        (Public Law 110-351), and the Child and Family Services Improvement and 
        Innovation Act (Public Law 112-34) provided new investments and services 
        to improve the outcomes of children in the foster care system;
Whereas May is an appropriate month to designate as National Foster Care Month 
        to provide an opportunity to acknowledge the child-welfare workforce, 
        foster parents, advocacy community, and mentors for their dedication, 
        accomplishments, and positive impact they have on the lives of children; 
        and
Whereas much remains to be done to ensure that all children have a safe, loving, 
        nurturing, and permanent family, regardless of age or special needs: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes National Foster Care Month as an opportunity 
        to raise awareness about the challenges faced by children in 
        the foster care system, acknowledging the dedication of foster 
        care parents, advocates, and workers, and encouraging Congress 
        to implement policy to improve the lives of children in the 
        foster care system;
            (2) encourages Congress to implement policy to improve the 
        lives of children in the foster care system;
            (3) supports the designation of May as National Foster Care 
        Month;
            (4) acknowledges the special needs of children in the 
        foster care system;
            (5) recognizes foster youth throughout the United States 
        for their ongoing tenacity, courage, and resilience while 
        facing life challenges;
            (6) acknowledges the exceptional alumni of the foster care 
        system who serve as advocates and role models for youth who 
        remain in care;
            (7) honors the commitment and dedication of the individuals 
        who work tirelessly to provide assistance and services to 
        children in the foster care system; and
            (8) reaffirms the need to continue working to improve the 
        outcomes of all children in the foster care system through 
        parts B and E of title IV of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 
        601 et seq.) and other programs designed to--
                    (A) support vulnerable families;
                    (B) invest in prevention and reunification 
                services;
                    (C) promote adoption and guardianship in cases 
                where reunification is not in the best interests of the 
                child;
                    (D) adequately serve those children brought into 
                the foster care system; and
                    (E) facilitate the successful transition into 
                adulthood for children that ``age out'' of the foster 
                care system.
                                 <all>
