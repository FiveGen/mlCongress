                               RESOLUTION


 
  Supporting the designation of April as Parkinson's Awareness Month.

Whereas Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease 
        in the United States, second only to Alzheimer's disease;
Whereas there is inadequate comprehensive data on the incidence and prevalence 
        of Parkinson's disease, as of 2011, it is estimated that the disease 
        affects from 500,000 to 1,500,000 people in the United States;
Whereas although research suggests the cause of Parkinson's disease is a 
        combination of genetic and environmental factors, the exact cause and 
        progression of the disease is still unknown;
Whereas there is no objective test for Parkinson's disease, and the rate of 
        misdiagnosis can be high;
Whereas symptoms of Parkinson's disease vary from person to person and include 
        tremors, slowness, difficulty with balance, swallowing, chewing, 
        speaking, rigidity, cognitive problems, dementia, mood disorders, such 
        as depression and anxiety, constipation, skin problems, and sleep 
        disruptions;
Whereas medications mask some symptoms of Parkinson's disease for a limited 
        amount of time each day, often with dose-limiting side effects;
Whereas ultimately the medications and treatments lose their effectiveness, 
        generally after 4 to 8 years, leaving the person unable to move, speak, 
        or swallow;
Whereas there is no cure, therapy, or drug to slow or halt the progression of 
        Parkinson's disease; and
Whereas increased education and research are needed to help find more effective 
        treatments with fewer side effects and, ultimately, an effective 
        treatment or cure for Parkinson's disease: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) supports the designation of April as Parkinson's 
        Awareness Month;
            (2) supports the goals and ideals of Parkinson's Awareness 
        Month;
            (3) continues to support research to find better 
        treatments, and eventually, a cure for Parkinson's disease;
            (4) recognizes the people living with Parkinson's who 
        participate in vital clinical trials to advance knowledge of 
        the disease; and
            (5) commends the dedication of local and regional 
        organizations, volunteers, and millions of Americans across the 
        country working to improve the quality of life of persons 
        living with Parkinson's disease and their families.
                                 <all>
