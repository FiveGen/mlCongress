                               RESOLUTION


 
   Designating December 15, 2012, as ``Wreaths Across America Day''.

Whereas, 21 years ago, the Wreaths Across America project began an annual 
        tradition, during the month of December, of donating, transporting, and 
        placing Maine balsam fir holiday wreaths on the graves of the fallen 
        heroes buried at Arlington National Cemetery;
Whereas, since that tradition began, through the hard work and generosity of the 
        individuals involved in the Wreaths Across America project, more than 
        350,000 wreaths have been sent to more than 800 locations, including 
        national cemeteries and veterans memorials in every State, and to 
        locations overseas;
Whereas the mission of the Wreaths Across America project to ``Remember, Honor, 
        Teach'' is carried out in part by coordinating wreath-laying ceremonies 
        at Arlington National Cemetery as well as veterans cemeteries and other 
        locations in all 50 States;
Whereas the Wreaths Across America project carries out a week-long veterans 
        parade between Maine and Virginia, stopping along the way to spread a 
        message about the importance of remembering the fallen heroes of the 
        United States, honoring those who serve, and teaching the people of the 
        United States about the sacrifices made by veterans and their families 
        to preserve our freedoms;
Whereas, in 2011, wreaths were sent to more than 700 locations across the United 
        States and overseas, 180 more locations than the previous year;
Whereas, in December 2012, the Patriot Guard Riders, a motorcycle and motor 
        vehicle group that is dedicated to patriotic events and includes more 
        than 250,000 members nationwide, will continue their tradition of 
        escorting a tractor-trailer filled with donated wreaths from Harrington, 
        Maine, to Arlington National Cemetery;
Whereas thousands of individuals volunteer each December to escort and lay the 
        wreaths;
Whereas December 10, 2011, was previously designated by the Senate as ``Wreaths 
        Across America Day''; and
Whereas the Wreaths Across America project will continue its proud legacy on 
        December 15, 2012, bringing approximately 125,000 wreaths to Arlington 
        National Cemetery on that day: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates December 15, 2012, as ``Wreaths Across 
        America Day'';
            (2) honors the Wreaths Across America project, the Patriot 
        Guard Riders, and all of the volunteers and donors involved in 
        this worthy tradition; and
            (3) recognizes the sacrifices our veterans, members of the 
        Armed Forces, and their families have made, and continue to 
        make, for our great Nation.
                                 <all>
