                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                           September 15, 2011

   Mr. Nelson of Nebraska (for himself, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Nelson of 
Florida, and Mr. Isakson) submitted the following resolution; which was 
    referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs

                            October 12, 2011

             Committee discharged; considered and agreed to

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
Supporting the goals and ideals of ``National Life Insurance Awareness 
                                Month''.

Whereas the vast majority of people in the United States recognize that life 
        insurance is important to protecting their loved ones;
Whereas the life insurance industry pays approximately $60,000,000,000 to 
        beneficiaries each year, providing a tremendous source of financial 
        relief and security to families that experience the loss of a loved one;
Whereas, as of the date of agreement to this resolution, the unfortunate reality 
        is that approximately 95,000,000 adults in the United States have no 
        life insurance, and ownership of both individual and employer-sponsored 
        life insurance has declined in recent years;
Whereas life insurance products protect against the uncertainties of life by 
        enabling individuals and families to manage the financial risks of 
        premature death, disability, and long-term care;
Whereas individuals, families, and businesses can benefit from professional 
        insurance and financial planning advice, including an assessment of 
        their life insurance needs; and
Whereas numerous groups supporting life insurance have designated September 2011 
        as ``National Life Insurance Awareness Month'' as a means to encourage 
        consumers to become more aware of their life insurance needs, seek 
        advice from qualified insurance professionals, and take the actions 
        necessary to achieve financial security for their loved ones: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of ``National Life 
        Insurance Awareness Month''; and
            (2) calls on the Federal Government, States, localities, 
        schools, nonprofit organizations, businesses, and the people of 
        the United States to observe the month with appropriate 
        programs and activities.
                                 <all>
