                               RESOLUTION


 
 Recognizing May 16, 2012, as Hereditary Angioedema Awareness Day and 
 expressing the sense of the Senate that more research and treatments 
                 are needed for Hereditary Angioedema.

Whereas Hereditary Angioedema (HAE) is a rare and potentially life-threatening 
        genetic disease, affecting between 1 in 10,000 and 1 in 50,000 people, 
        leading to patients being undiagnosed or misdiagnosed for many years;
Whereas HAE is characterized by symptoms including episodes of edema or swelling 
        in various body parts including the hands, feet, gastrointestinal tract, 
        face, and airway;
Whereas patients often experience swelling in the intestinal wall, causing bouts 
        of excruciating abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, and swelling of 
        the airway, which can lead to death by asphyxiation;
Whereas a defect in the gene that controls the C1-inhibitor blood protein causes 
        production of either inadequate or non-functioning C1-inhibitor protein, 
        leading to an inability to regulate complex biochemical interactions of 
        blood-based systems involved in disease fighting, inflammatory response, 
        and coagulation;
Whereas HAE is an autosomal dominant disease, and 50 percent of patients with 
        the disease inherited the defective gene from a parent, while the other 
        50 percent developed a spontaneous mutation of the C1-inhibitor gene at 
        conception;
Whereas HAE patients often experience their first HAE attack during childhood or 
        adolescence, and continue to suffer from subsequent attacks for the 
        duration of their lives;
Whereas HAE attacks can be triggered by infections, minor injuries or dental 
        procedures, emotional or mental stress, and certain hormonal or blood 
        medications;
Whereas the onset or duration of an HAE attack can negatively affect a person's 
        physical, emotional, economic, educational, and social well-being due to 
        activity limitations;
Whereas the annual cost for treatment per patient can exceed $500,000, causing a 
        substantial economic burden;
Whereas there is a significant need for increased and normalized medical 
        professional education regarding HAE; and
Whereas there is also a significant need for further research on HAE to improve 
        diagnosis and treatment options for patients; Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That--
            (1) the Senate--
                    (A) recognizes and celebrates May 16, 2012, as 
                Hereditary Angioedema Awareness Day; and
                    (B) supports increased awareness of Hereditary 
                Angioedema (HAE) by physicians and the public.
