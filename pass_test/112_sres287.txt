_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
    Designating October 2011 as ``Filipino American History Month''.

Whereas October 18, 1587, when the first ``Luzones Indios'' set foot in Morro 
        Bay, California, on board the Manila-built galleon ship Nuestra Senora 
        de Esperanza, marks the earliest documented Filipino presence in the 
        continental United States;
Whereas the Filipino American National Historical Society recognizes the year of 
        1763 as the date of the first permanent Filipino settlement in the 
        United States in St. Malo, Louisiana;
Whereas the recognition of the first permanent Filipino settlement in the United 
        States adds new perspective to United States history by bringing 
        attention to the economic, cultural, social, and other notable 
        contributions that Filipino Americans have made in countless ways toward 
        the development of the United States;
Whereas the Filipino-American community is the third largest Asian-American 
        group in the United States, with a population of approximately 3,417,000 
        individuals;
Whereas Filipino-American servicemen and servicewomen have a longstanding 
        history of serving in the Armed Forces, from the Civil War to the Iraq 
        and Afghanistan conflicts, including the 250,000 Filipinos who fought 
        under the United States flag during World War II to protect and defend 
        the United States;
Whereas 9 Filipino Americans have received the Congressional Medal of Honor, the 
        highest award for valor in action against an enemy force that can be 
        bestowed upon an individual serving in the Armed Forces;
Whereas Filipino Americans play an integral role in the United States health 
        care system as nurses, doctors, and other medical professionals;
Whereas Filipino Americans have contributed greatly to music, dance, literature, 
        education, business, literature, journalism, sports, fashion, politics, 
        government, science, technology, the fine arts, and other fields in the 
        United States that enrich the landscape of the country;
Whereas efforts should continue to promote the study of Filipino-American 
        history and culture, as mandated in the mission statement of the 
        Filipino American National Historical Society, because the roles of 
        Filipino Americans and other people of color largely have been 
        overlooked in the writing, teaching, and learning of United States 
        history;
Whereas it is imperative for Filipino-American youth to have positive role 
        models to instill in them the significance of education, complemented 
        with the richness of their ethnicity and the value of their legacy; and
Whereas Filipino American History Month is celebrated during the month of 
        October 2011: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates October 2011 as ``Filipino American History 
        Month'';
            (2) recognizes the celebration of Filipino American History 
        Month as--
                    (A) a study of the advancement of Filipino 
                Americans;
                    (B) a time of reflection and remembrance of the 
                many notable contributions Filipino Americans have made 
                to the United States; and
                    (C) a time to renew efforts toward the research and 
                examination of history and culture in order to provide 
                an opportunity for all people in the United States to 
                learn and appreciate more about Filipino Americans and 
                their historic contributions to the United States; and
            (3) urges the people of the United States to observe 
        Filipino American History Month with appropriate programs and 
        activities.
