      Recognizing women serving in the United States Armed Forces.

Whereas women have served with distinction in the United States Armed Forces 
        since the American Revolution and have made significant and lasting 
        contributions to the security of the United States;
Whereas in 2011, women comprise nearly 16 percent of the United States Armed 
        Forces and serve in positions of responsibility in the active and 
        reserve components of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast 
        Guard, as compared with less than 5 percent in 1976 when women were 
        first integrated into the service academies;
Whereas women serve at the highest levels in the Department of Defense and other 
        governmental organizations contributing to the defense of the United 
        States; and
Whereas the accomplishments of generations of women have contributed to the 
        history of the United States Armed Forces and to the strength of the 
        United States: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring), 
That Congress--
            (1) recognizes the importance of women to national defense 
        throughout the history of the United States; and
            (2) encourages the people of the United States to honor 
        women who have served and who continue to serve the United 
        States in the United States Armed Forces.

            Passed the Senate February 28, 2011.

            Attest:

                                                NANCY ERICKSON,

                                                             Secretary.
