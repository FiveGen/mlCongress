                               RESOLUTION


 
 Recognizing the religious and historical significance of the festival 
                               of Diwali.

Whereas Diwali, a festival of great significance to Indian Americans and South 
        Asian Americans, is celebrated annually by Hindus, Sikhs, and Jains 
        throughout India, the United States, and the world;
Whereas Diwali is a festival of lights, during which celebrants light small oil 
        lamps, place the lamps around the home, and pray for health, knowledge, 
        peace, wealth, and prosperity in the new year;
Whereas the lights symbolize the light of knowledge within the individual that 
        overwhelms the darkness of ignorance, empowering each celebrant to do 
        good deeds and show compassion to others;
Whereas Diwali falls on the last day of the last month in the lunar calendar and 
        is celebrated as a day of thanksgiving for the homecoming of the Lord 
        Rama and worship of Lord Ganesha, the remover of obstacles and bestower 
        of blessings, at the beginning of the new year for many Hindus;
Whereas for Sikhs, Diwali is celebrated as Bandhi Chhor Diwas (The Celebration 
        of Freedom), in honor of the release from prison of the sixth guru, Guru 
        Hargobind; and
Whereas for Jains, Diwali marks the anniversary of the attainment of moksha, or 
        liberation, by Mahavira, the last of the Tirthankaras (the great 
        teachers of Jain dharma), at the end of his life in 527 B.C.: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes the religious and historical significance of 
        the festival of Diwali; and
            (2) in observance of Diwali, the festival of lights, 
        expresses its deepest respect for Indian Americans and South 
        Asian Americans, as well as fellow countrymen and diaspora 
        throughout the world on this significant occasion.
