                               RESOLUTION


 
  Commemorating the dedication of the Strategic Air Command Memorial 
             during the 20th anniversary of its stand down.

Whereas Strategic Air Command was formed on March 21, 1946, to provide the 
        United States with long-range bombing capabilities;
Whereas Strategic Air Command operations were moved to Offutt Air Force Base in 
        1948 to avoid a surprise attack from the growing nuclear threat by the 
        Soviet Union during the Cold War;
Whereas the men and women of Strategic Air Command perfected aerial refueling, 
        allowing Strategic Air Command bombers to reach any spot in the world 
        and advancing the ability of the United States to project military power 
        worldwide;
Whereas in 1953, following the Korean War, the defense strategy of the United 
        States shifted and President Eisenhower designated Strategic Air Command 
        as the primary nuclear deterrent for the United States;
Whereas the Strategic Air Command played a major role in the triad of aircraft, 
        missiles, and submarines that provided an undefeatable nuclear force 
        that prevented nuclear war and kept the Soviet Union at bay until the 
        demise of the Soviet Union in December 1991;
Whereas Strategic Air Command is credited with the development of the Snark, 
        Atlas, and Minuteman missiles;
Whereas Strategic Air Command maintained continuous airborne alert operations 
        from October 1957 until September 1991, which many consider the longest 
        continuous military operation in history;
Whereas in 1962, the visibility of Strategic Air Command bombers responding to 
        the DEFCON 2 order issued by President Kennedy during the Cuban Missile 
        Crisis presented a clear indication to the Soviet Union of the 
        determination of the United States to remove Soviet missiles from Cuba;
Whereas at its height in 1962, Strategic Air Command employed 283,000 personnel 
        and maintained 3,400 aircraft and 224 land-based missiles;
Whereas in December 1972, 33 crewmembers and 10 B-52 bombers supported by 
        Strategic Air Command were lost during Operation Linebacker II in North 
        Vietnam during the aerial bombing campaign that forced Vietnamese 
        leadership back to negotiations and a peace settlement;
Whereas the need for absolute command and control by national leaders led 
        Strategic Air Command to organize the National Emergency Airborne 
        Command Post operation, which became the National Airborne Operations 
        Center and the E-4B aircraft operating at Offutt Air Force Base;
Whereas the operational practices and procedures for safe and secure nuclear 
        weapons were established by Strategic Air Command and continue under the 
        leadership of United States Strategic Command and Air Force Global 
        Strike Command;
Whereas the Strategic Air Command performed the assigned mission flawlessly 
        according to its famous motto, ``Peace is Our Profession'';
Whereas the United States, and particularly the State of Nebraska, is extremely 
        grateful to those who served the United States at Strategic Air Command; 
        and
Whereas the Senate recognizes the service and dedication of the individuals 
        whose unyielding commitment and sacrifice contributed to the continued 
        safety of the United States for over 4 decades: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes the 20th anniversary of the stand down of 
        Strategic Air Command and the immeasurable contributions and 
        prominent role of Strategic Air Command in national security 
        and nuclear deterrence during the Cold War;
            (2) commemorates the dedication of the Strategic Air 
        Command Memorial in the State of Nebraska, which pays tribute 
        to the men and women who worked tirelessly to make Strategic 
        Air Command the most powerful and professional military 
        organization in the world; and
            (3) honors the personnel who served at Strategic Air 
        Command and those who have carried on the tradition of 
        excellence through service at United States Strategic Command.
                                 <all>
