                               RESOLUTION


 
   Designating Thursday, November 17, 2011, as ``Feed America Day''.

Whereas Thanksgiving Day celebrates the spirit of selfless giving and an 
        appreciation for family and friends;
Whereas the spirit of Thanksgiving Day is a virtue upon which the United States 
        was founded;
Whereas, according to the Department of Agriculture, roughly 48,000,000 people 
        in the United States, including 16,200,000 children, continue to live in 
        households that do not have an adequate supply of food; and
Whereas selfless sacrifice breeds a genuine spirit of thanksgiving, both 
        affirming and restoring fundamental principles in our society: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates Thursday, November 17, 2011, as ``Feed 
        America Day''; and
            (2) encourages the people of the United States to sacrifice 
        2 meals on Thursday, November 17, 2011, and to donate the money 
        that would have been spent on that food to the religious or 
        charitable organization of their choice for the purpose of 
        feeding the hungry.
                                 <all>
