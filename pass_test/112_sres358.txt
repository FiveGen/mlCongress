                               RESOLUTION


 
    Expressing support for the designation of January 28, 2012, as 
                     ``National Data Privacy Day''.

Whereas new and innovative technologies enhance our lives by increasing our 
        ability to communicate, learn, share, and produce;
Whereas integration of new and innovative technologies into our everyday lives 
        has the potential to compromise the privacy of our personal information 
        if appropriate protection is not taken;
Whereas protecting the privacy of personal information is a global imperative 
        for governments, commerce, civil society, and individuals;
Whereas many individuals and companies are unaware of the risks to the privacy 
        of personal information posed by new and innovative technologies, of 
        data protection and privacy laws, or of the specific steps they can take 
        to protect the privacy of personal information;
Whereas ``National Data Privacy Day'' constitutes an international collaboration 
        and a nationwide effort to educate and raise awareness about data 
        privacy and about protecting the privacy of personal information;
Whereas the fourth annual recognition of ``National Data Privacy Day'' by 
        Congress would encourage more people nationwide to be aware of data 
        privacy and to protect the privacy of their personal information;
Whereas government officials and agencies from the United States, Canada, and 
        Europe, as well as representatives of businesses and nonprofit 
        organizations, privacy professionals, academic communities, legal 
        scholars, educators, and others with an interest in data privacy are 
        working together on January 28, 2012, to educate and raise awareness 
        about data privacy and about protecting the privacy of personal 
        information;
Whereas on January 28, 2012, privacy professionals and educators are being 
        encouraged to discuss data privacy and security with teens and young 
        adults in schools across the United States, and parents are being 
        encouraged to discuss data privacy and security with their children; and
Whereas January 28, 2012, would be an appropriate day to designate as ``National 
        Data Privacy Day'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) supports the designation of January 28, 2012, as 
        ``National Data Privacy Day'';
            (2) encourages State and local governments to observe the 
        day with appropriate activities and initiatives that raise 
        awareness about data privacy;
            (3) encourages privacy professionals and educators to 
        discuss data privacy and security with teens and young adults 
        in schools across the United States;
            (4) encourages corporations to take steps to protect the 
        privacy and security of the personal information of their 
        clients and consumers, to design data privacy into products 
        they create wherever possible, and to promote trust in 
        technologies; and
            (5) encourages individuals across the United States to 
        learn about data privacy and the specific steps they can take 
        to protect the privacy of their personal information.
                                 <all>
