                               RESOLUTION


 
   Designating the first full week of December in 2011 as ``National 
                         Christmas Tree Week''.

Whereas Christmas trees are grown in all 50 States;
Whereas Christmas trees have been sold commercially in the United States since 
        about 1850;
Whereas Edward Johnson, assistant to Thomas Edison, came up with the idea of 
        electric lights for Christmas trees in 1882;
Whereas President Calvin Coolidge started the National Christmas Tree Lighting 
        ceremony on the White House lawn in 1923;
Whereas there are close to 15,000 farms growing Christmas trees in the United 
        States;
Whereas there are approximately 100,000 people employed full or part-time in the 
        Christmas tree industry;
Whereas Christmas tree farms in the United States planted approximately 
        35,000,000 Christmas trees in 2011 to replace those harvested in 2010; 
        and
Whereas growing Christmas trees preserves green space and small family-owned 
        farms, provides habitats for wildlife, and sequesters carbon dioxide: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates the first full week of December in 2011 as 
        ``National Christmas Tree Week'';
            (2) encourages the celebration of Christmas trees during 
        that week;
            (3) recognizes the role Christmas trees have played in the 
        history of the United States;
            (4) reaffirms the environmental benefits of Christmas tree 
        farms and recycled Christmas trees;
            (5) encourages the recycling of Christmas trees after the 
        holiday season; and
            (6) celebrates the joy Christmas trees bring to families 
        across the United States.
                                 <all>
