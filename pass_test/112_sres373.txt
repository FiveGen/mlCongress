                               RESOLUTION


 
   Recognizing February 14, 2012, as the centennial of the State of 
                                Arizona.

Whereas, after many changes in government administration, territorial divisions, 
        and additions, including lands acquired through the Treaty of Guadalupe 
        Hidalgo and the Gadsden Purchase, the Territory of Arizona came into 
        existence nearly 150 years ago after serving as a sacred home to native 
        cultures for thousands of years;
Whereas Arizona is home to many of the greatest natural treasures of the United 
        States, including the Sedona Red Rocks, the White Mountains, the Painted 
        Desert, the Petrified Forest, Monument Valley, Saguaro National Park, 
        the 12,000-foot San Francisco Peaks, and the Grand Canyon, 1 of the 7 
        natural wonders of the world, which explorer John Wesley Powell said 
        could not be ``adequately represented in symbols of speech, nor by 
        speech itself'';
Whereas Arizona is also home to man-made wonders, including innovative projects 
        that have allowed much-needed fresh water to flow to Arizona communities 
        for decades, such as the Hoover Dam, the Glen Canyon Dam, the Central 
        Arizona Project, the Salt River Project, and the keystone element of the 
        Salt River Project, the Theodore Roosevelt Dam;
Whereas Arizona has long been recognized for being rich in natural resources, 
        including the famous ``5 C's'', copper, cattle, cotton, citrus, and 
        climate, that continue to sustain the economies of Arizona and the 
        United States;
Whereas Arizona is a mosaic of cultures, cuisines, and traditions, drawing 
        continuing influence from 21 proud American Indian tribes and the early 
        prospectors, ranchers, cowboys, adventurers, and missionaries, as well 
        as a dynamic Latino community;
Whereas all of these Arizonans were, and remain, bound by a strong sense of 
        independence and a willingness to persevere against the odds, and are 
        again picking themselves up in the wake of devastating wildfires and 
        economic challenges;
Whereas this unique Arizona spirit has nurtured leaders in the arts, justice, 
        conservation, and science, as well as some of the greatest statesmen in 
        the 20th century United States, including Senators Ernest McFarland, 
        Carl Hayden, and Barry Goldwater, Representative Morris Udall, and 
        Supreme Court Justices William Rehnquist and Sandra Day O'Connor;
Whereas the many military installations in Arizona have provided valuable 
        contributions to the defense of the United States and will continue to 
        do so for years to come;
Whereas, after nearly half a century as a territory of the United States, 
        Arizona became the 48th State of the United States, and the last 
        contiguous State, on February 14, 1912;
Whereas the people of the United States now have the opportunity to celebrate 
        the natural splendor, innovative spirit, and cultural diversity that 
        have made Arizona so special for the past 100 years and will continue to 
        make Arizona special for centuries to come: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate recognizes February 14, 2012 as the 
centennial of the State of Arizona.
                                 <all>
