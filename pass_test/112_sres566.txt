                               RESOLUTION


 
     Designating September 29, 2012, as ``National Estuaries Day''.

Whereas the estuary regions of the United States comprise a significant share of 
        the national economy, with 53 percent of the population, 40 percent of 
        the employment, and 49 percent of the economic output of the United 
        States located in the estuary regions of the United States;
Whereas projections indicate that 75 percent of the total population of the 
        United States will live and work in coastal counties by 2025;
Whereas coasts and estuaries contribute more than $800,000,000,000 annually in 
        trade and commerce to the United States economy;
Whereas more than 43 percent of all adults in the United States visit a sea 
        coast or estuary at least once a year to participate in some form of 
        recreation, generating $8,000,000,000 to $12,000,000,000 in revenue 
        annually;
Whereas more than 28,000,000 jobs in the United States are supported by 
        commercial and recreational fishing, boating, tourism, and other coastal 
        industries that rely on healthy estuaries;
Whereas estuaries provide vital habitat for countless species of fish and 
        wildlife, including many that are listed as threatened or endangered;
Whereas estuaries provide critical ecosystem services that protect human health 
        and public safety, including water filtration, flood control, shoreline 
        stabilization and erosion prevention, and the protection of coastal 
        communities during extreme weather events;
Whereas the United States has lost more than 110,000,000 acres, or 50 percent, 
        of the wetland of the United States since the first European settlers 
        arrived;
Whereas bays once filled with fish and oysters have become dead zones filled 
        with excess nutrients, chemical wastes, harmful algae, and marine 
        debris;
Whereas changes in sea level can impact estuarine water quality and estuarine 
        habitat;
Whereas the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1451 et seq.) 
        declares that it is the national policy to preserve, protect, develop, 
        and if possible, to restore or enhance, the resources of the coastal 
        zone of the United States, including estuaries, for current and future 
        generations;
Whereas 24 coastal and Great Lake States and territories of the United States 
        contain a National Estuary Program or a National Estuarine Research 
        Reserve System;
Whereas scientific study leads to better understanding of the benefits of 
        estuaries to human and ecological communities;
Whereas the Federal Government, State, local, and tribal governments, national 
        and community organizations, and individuals work together to 
        effectively manage the estuaries of the United States;
Whereas estuary restoration efforts restore natural infrastructure in local 
        communities in a cost effective manner, helping to create jobs and 
        reestablish the natural functions of estuaries that yield countless 
        benefits; and
Whereas September 29, 2012, has been designated as ``National Estuaries Day'' to 
        increase awareness among all people of the United States, including 
        Federal, State and local government officials, about the importance of 
        healthy estuaries and the need to protect and restore estuaries: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates September 29, 2012, as ``National Estuaries 
        Day'';
            (2) supports the goals and ideals of National Estuaries 
        Day;
            (3) acknowledges the importance of estuaries to sustaining 
        employment and the economic well-being and prosperity of the 
        United States;
            (4) recognizes that persistent threats undermine the health 
        of the estuaries of the United States;
            (5) applauds the work of national and community 
        organizations and public partners that promote public 
        awareness, understanding, protection, and restoration of 
        estuaries;
            (6) reaffirms the support of the Senate for estuaries, 
        including the scientific study, preservation, protection, and 
        restoration of estuaries; and
            (7) expresses the intent of the Senate to continue working 
        to understand, protect, and restore the estuaries of the United 
        States.
