                               RESOLUTION


 
   Expressing the sense of the Senate regarding coming together as a 
     Nation and ceasing all work or other activity for a moment of 
remembrance beginning at 1:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time on September 11, 
    2011, in honor of the 10th anniversary of the terrorist attacks 
       committed against the United States on September 11, 2001.

Whereas at 8:46 AM, on September 11, 2001, hijacked American Airlines Flight 11 
        crashed into the upper portion of the North Tower of the World Trade 
        Center in New York City, New York;
Whereas 17 minutes later, at 9:03 AM, hijacked United Airlines Flight 175 
        crashed into the South Tower of the World Trade Center;
Whereas at 9:37 AM, the west wall of the Pentagon was hit by hijacked American 
        Airlines Flight 77, the impact of which caused immediate and 
        catastrophic damage to the headquarters of the Department of Defense;
Whereas at approximately 10:00 AM, the passengers and crew of hijacked United 
        Airlines Flight 93 acted heroically to retake control of the airplane 
        and thwart the taking of additional American lives by crashing the 
        airliner in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, and, in doing so, gave their 
        lives to save countless others;
Whereas nearly 3,000 innocent civilians were killed in the heinous attacks of 
        September 11, 2001;
Whereas tens of thousands of individuals narrowly escaped the attacks at the 
        Pentagon and World Trade Center and, as witnesses to this tragedy, are 
        forever changed;
Whereas countless fire departments, police departments, first responders, 
        governmental officials, workers, emergency medical personnel, and 
        volunteers responded immediately and heroically to those horrific 
        events;
Whereas the Fire Department of New York suffered 343 fatalities on September 11, 
        2001, the largest loss of life of any emergency response agency in 
        United States history;
Whereas the Port Authority Police Department suffered 37 fatalities in the 
        attacks, the largest loss of life of any police force in United States 
        history in a single day;
Whereas the New York Police Department suffered 23 fatalities as a result of the 
        terrorist attacks;
Whereas the impact of that day on public health continues through 2011, as 
        nearly 90,000 people are at risk of or suffering from negative health 
        effects as a result of the events of September 11, 2001, including 
        14,000 workers and 2,400 community residents who are sick, and tens of 
        thousands of others whose health is being monitored;
Whereas 10 years later, the people of the United States and people around the 
        world continue to mourn the tremendous loss of innocent life on that 
        fateful day;
Whereas 10 years later, thousands of men and women in the United States Armed 
        Forces remain in harm's way defending the United States against those 
        who seek to threaten the United States;
Whereas on the 10th anniversary of this tragic day, the thoughts of the people 
        of the United States are with all of the victims of the events of 
        September 11, 2001, and their families;
Whereas the lives of Americans were changed forever on September 11, 2001, when 
        events threatened the American way of life;
Whereas in December 2001, Congress and the President joined together to 
        designate September 11 as Patriot Day (Public Law 107-89);
Whereas in September 2002, and each September thereafter through September 2008, 
        President Bush issued Proclamations 7590, 7702, 7812, 7929, 8047, 8174, 
        and 8286 (67 Fed. Reg. 57125; 68 Fed. Reg. 53013; 69 Fed. Reg. 55717; 70 
        Fed. Reg. 54467; 71 Fed. Reg. 53959; 72 Fed. Reg. 51553; 73 Fed. Reg. 
        52773) proclaiming September 11 of that year, respectively, as Patriot 
        Day;
Whereas in 2009, Congress and the President joined together to designate 
        September 11 as a National Day of Service and Remembrance under the 
        Serve America Act (Public Law 111-13; 123 Stat. 1460);
Whereas in September 2009 and 2010, President Obama issued Proclamation 8413 (74 
        Fed. Reg. 47045) and Proclamation 8559 (75 Fed. Reg. 56463) proclaiming 
        September 11, 2009, and September 11, 2010, respectively, as Patriot Day 
        and National Day of Service and Remembrance; and
Whereas September 11 will never, and should never, be just another day in the 
        hearts and minds of all people of the United States: Now, therefore, be 
        it
    Resolved, That the Senate--

        first responders, law enforcement personnel, State and local

        enforcement personnel, and their families, who have given so

        cause of freedom and defend the security of the United States;
            (5) reaffirms that the people of the United States will 
        never forget the challenges our country endured on and since 
        September 11, 2001, and will work tirelessly to defeat those 
        who attacked the United States; and
            (6) on the 10th anniversary of this tragic day in United 
        States history--
