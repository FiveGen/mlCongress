                               RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing the sense of the Senate regarding Raymond Weeks and his 
             efforts in the establishment of Veterans Day.

Whereas November 11, 2012, is the 65th anniversary of National Veterans Day in 
        Birmingham, Alabama;
Whereas the National Veterans Day in Birmingham is the longest running 
        celebration of Veterans Day in the Nation;
Whereas, on November 11, 1946, World War II veteran Raymond Weeks presented 
        General Eisenhower a program design proposing to replace Armistice Day 
        with a National Veterans Day in 1947;
Whereas the very first Veterans Day celebration was held in Birmingham by the 
        National Veterans Day Organization in 1947;
Whereas President Eisenhower signed into law on June 1, 1954, the Act 
        proclaiming November 11 as Veterans Day (Public Law 380; 83rd Congress);
Whereas in 1954, the National Veterans Day Volunteer Organization, started by 
        Raymond Weeks, expanded to organize a multi-day celebration including, 
        but not limited to, a Veterans Day Parade, a World Peace Luncheon, and 
        presentation during the National Veterans Award Dinner of the National 
        Veterans Award;
Whereas these three events have been held every year since 1954;
Whereas the briefing for President Reagan by Elizabeth Dole for the Presidential 
        Citizens Medals cited Raymond Weeks as the ``Father of Veterans Day'';
Whereas President Reagan recognized Raymond Weeks as the driving force behind 
        Veterans Day while presenting Raymond Weeks with the Presidential 
        Citizens Medal on November 11, 1982;
Whereas Raymond Weeks should be recognized for his push to honor the great men 
        and women who have served their country with a special day of 
        recognition; and
Whereas Birmingham, Alabama, should be recognized for its contributions to the 
        institution of Veterans Day: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes Birmingham, Alabama, as the home to the 
        first and longest running celebration of Veterans Day;
            (2) recognizes Raymond Weeks for his pioneering efforts in 
        the establishment of Veterans Day; and
            (3) honors the sacrifices of, and pays tribute to, the men 
        and women of the United States in uniform who risk life and 
        limb for their country at home and overseas.
