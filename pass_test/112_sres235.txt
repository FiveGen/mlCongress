                               RESOLUTION


 
       Designating 2011 as ``The Year of the Family Caregiver''.

Whereas there are more than 65,000,000 people in the United States serving as 
        family caregivers for a family member or friend with a disability, 
        chronic illness, or the frailties associated with old age;
Whereas family caregivers in the United States are family, friends, partners, 
        and neighbors who choose to provide care out of feelings of love or a 
        sense of duty;
Whereas family caregivers deal with significant medical and psycho-social issues 
        that require complex care management and coordination with numerous 
        medical providers;
Whereas family caregivers provide 80 percent of all long-term care services in 
        the United States;
Whereas despite the physical, psychological, and financial hardship that 
        caregivers endure, these individuals provide high-quality services that 
        bring countless benefits to their care recipients and to society; and
Whereas the people of the United States should acknowledge the vital role of 
        family caregivers, enable such caregivers to live healthier, less 
        stressful lives, and enhance the ability of family caregivers to improve 
        the health and well-being of those that they care for: Now, therefore, 
        be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes the year 2011 as the 11-year anniversary of 
        the National Family Caregiver Support Program;
            (2) applauds the Administration on Aging and national and 
        community based organizations that support family caregivers;
            (3) applauds the family, friends, partners, and neighbors 
        who provide long-term care services; and
            (4) designates 2011 as ``The Year of the Family 
        Caregiver''.
                                 <all>
