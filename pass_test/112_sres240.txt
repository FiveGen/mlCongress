                               RESOLUTION


 
   Condemning the horrific attacks on government buildings in Oslo, 
Norway, and a youth camp on Ut<ya Island, Norway, on July 22, 2011, and 
                          for other purposes.

Whereas, on July 22, 2011, at least eight people were brutally killed when 
        government buildings were bombed in Oslo, Norway;
Whereas, also on July 22, 2011, at least 68 people, a majority of them children 
        and young adults, were brutally killed when a youth camp was attacked on 
        Ut<ya Island, Norway;
Whereas, also on July 22, 2011, as many as 96 people were injured by these dual 
        attacks;
Whereas these twin attacks brought horrific violence, pain, and suffering upon 
        innocent Norwegians and their families and friends;
Whereas the Government and people of Norway have condemned the terrorist attacks 
        and called the events an ``atrocity,'' a ``nightmare,'' and a ``national 
        tragedy'';
Whereas Norway is recognized around the world as a country that is both peaceful 
        and peace-seeking;
Whereas Oslo, Norway, is home to the Norwegian Nobel Committee, which annually 
        selects winners of the Nobel Peace Prize;
Whereas Norway was a founding member of the United Nations in 1945, a Norwegian 
        was the first Secretary-General of the United Nations, and Norway was a 
        founding member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 
        1949;
Whereas Norway has for years offered safe haven to refugees and the politically 
        persecuted from around the world;
Whereas over 4,500,000 Americans of Norwegian ancestry now reside in the United 
        States, with the state of Minnesota being home to the largest number of 
        people of Norwegian heritage outside of Norway itself;
Whereas the Prime Minister of Norway, Jens Stoltenberg, has said, ``We must 
        never let our values, our way of life, be destroyed by blind violence,'' 
        and pledged that Norway ``will respond with more democracy, more 
        openness, and more humanity, but never naivete'';
Whereas the Foreign Minister of Norway, Jonas Gahr St<re, remarked, ``The nature 
        of the Norwegian democracy will not change. Norway will continue to 
        stand for engagement in the world where we commit our resources and our 
        convictions.'';
Whereas President Barack Obama remarked that ``[i]t's a reminder that the entire 
        international community has a stake in preventing this kind of terror 
        from occurring,'' and later said, ``You should know that the thoughts 
        and prayers of all Americans are with the people of Norway and that we 
        will stand beside [Norway] every step of the way.'';
Whereas, on Monday, July 25, 2011, there was a moment of silence throughout 
        Norway and other Nordic countries, followed by a memorial attended by 
        more than 150,000 people outside the city hall in Oslo for a ``Rose 
        March,'' in which participants carried white or red roses; and
Whereas Crown Prince Haakon of Norway told those gathered at the memorial, 
        ``Tonight the streets are filled with love.'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) condemns in the strongest terms the senseless terrorist 
        attacks that occurred in Norway on July 22, 2011, causing many 
        deaths and injuries;
            (2) further condemns all terrorist actions, including those 
        motivated by hatred and religious or cultural intolerance;
            (3) expresses deep sympathy, solidarity, and condolences to 
        the victims of the atrocious acts, their families, and the 
        people and Government of Norway;
            (4) emphasizes the bonds of friendship and shared heritage 
        between the United States and Norway;
            (5) expresses unwavering support to the Government and 
        people of Norway as they recover from these horrific attacks;
            (6) affirms its resolve to combat all forms of senseless 
        violence and terrorism, both domestically and abroad; and
            (7) calls on all people to join together to denounce acts 
        of hatred and fear and promote peace and tolerance in their 
        communities and around the world.
                                 <all>
