Honoring the 29 coal miners who perished in the explosion at the Upper 
   Big Branch Mine in Montcoal, West Virginia, on April 5, 2010, and 
 remembering all those who have lost their lives while mining for the 
              resources on which the United States relies.

Whereas West Virginia coal miners and their predecessors not only have a strong 
        commitment to providing a good living for their families, but also take 
        a deep and patriotic pride in the fact that their work and the energy 
        they produce has made the United States strong and free;
Whereas coal mining has been, and remains, an important part of the economy of 
        the United States;
Whereas coal accounts for nearly \1/2\ of the electricity produced in the United 
        States;
Whereas coal has been commercially mined in what is now the State of West 
        Virginia since 1810;
Whereas since 1810, West Virginia miners and their families have sacrificed 
        greatly to mine the coal that powers the economy of the United States;
Whereas, on April 5, 2010, 29 heroic and patriotic West Virginia miners 
        tragically lost their lives in an explosion at the Upper Big Branch Mine 
        in Montcoal, West Virginia;
Whereas a search and rescue effort was launched immediately following the 
        explosion that involved dozens of courageous volunteers, first 
        responders, and mine rescue teams who fearlessly risked their lives to 
        rescue survivors and find lost miners;
Whereas Carl ``Pee Wee'' Acord, Jason Matthew Atkins, Christopher Lee Bell, Sr., 
        Gregory Steven Brock, Kenneth A. Chapman, Sr., Robert Eugene Clark, Cory 
        Davis, Charles Timothy Davis, Michael Lee Elswick, William Ildon 
        Griffith, Steven J. ``Smiley'' Harrah, Edward ``Dean'' Jones, Richard

        Allan Scott, Grover Dale Skeens, Benny Ray Willingham, and Ricky L. 
        Workman perished in the explosion at the Upper Big Branch Mine;
Whereas the terrible tragedy broke the hearts of the people of the United 
        States;
Whereas since the beginning of 2010, 77 miners of coal and other resources have 
        lost their lives on the job, and thousands more have been injured or 
        diagnosed with occupational illnesses, such as Black Lung disease;
Whereas the families of the deceased continue to suffer, as do those miners who 
        have become seriously injured or ill; and
Whereas Congress has long recognized the need to protect the safety and health 
        of miners: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) honors the coal miners who lost their lives in the 
        explosion at the Upper Big Branch Mine in Montcoal, West 
        Virginia, on April 5, 2010;
            (2) extends its continued heartfelt condolences to the 
        families of the deceased, who are still looking for answers to 
        the tragedy;
            (3) recognizes the hardships faced by survivors of the 
        tragedy and fellow miners who worked side-by-side with the 
        deceased;
            (4) acknowledges the risks faced by all miners, as well as 
        the important and often overlooked contributions that miners 
        make to the United States;
            (5) expresses its appreciation for the volunteers, first 
        responders, and mine rescue teams who fearlessly risk their 
        lives to save miners after tragedies; and
            (6) reaffirms its commitment to keep miners safe and 
        healthy on the job.
