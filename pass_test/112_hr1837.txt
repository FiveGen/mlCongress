                by the Secretary of the Interior to each contractor no 
                later than 180 days after enactment; and
                    (B) require that, notwithstanding subsection 
                (c)(2), construction costs or other capitalized costs 
                incurred after the effective date of the contract or 
                not reflected in the schedule referenced in 
                subparagraph (A), and properly assignable to such 
                contractor, shall be repaid in not more than 5 years 
                after notification of the allocation if such amount is 
                a result of a collective annual allocation of capital 
                costs to the contractors exercising contract 
                conversions under this subsection of less than 
                $5,000,000. If such amount is $5,000,000 or greater, 
                such cost shall be repaid as provided by applicable 
                reclamation law, provided that the reference to the 
                amount of $5,000,000 shall not be a precedent in any 
                other context.
    (b) Final Adjustment.--The amounts paid pursuant to subsection (a) 
shall be subject to adjustment following a final cost allocation by the 
Secretary of the Interior upon completion of the construction of the 
Central Valley Project. In the event that the final cost allocation 
indicates that the costs properly assignable to the contractor are 
greater than what has been paid by the contractor, the contractor shall 
be obligated to pay the remaining allocated costs. The term of such 
additional repayment contract shall be no less than 1 year and no more 
than 10 years, however, mutually agreeable provisions regarding the 
rate of repayment of such amount may be developed by the parties. In 
the event that the final cost allocation indicates that the costs 
properly assignable to the contractor are less than what the contractor 
has paid, the Secretary of the Interior is authorized and directed to 
credit such overpayment as an offset against any outstanding or future 
obligation of the contractor.
    (c) Applicability of Certain Provisions.--
            (1) Notwithstanding any repayment obligation under 
        subsection (a)(3)(B) or subsection (b), upon a contractor's 
        compliance with and discharge of the obligation of repayment of 
        the construction costs as provided in subsection (a)(3)(A), the 
        ownership and full-cost pricing limitations of any provision of 
        Federal reclamation law shall not apply to lands in such 
        district.
            (2) Notwithstanding any repayment obligation under 
        paragraph (3)(B) or paragraph (4)(B) of subsection (a), or 
        subsection (b), upon a contractor's compliance with and 
        discharge of the obligation of repayment of the construction 
        costs as provided in paragraphs (3)(A) and (4)(A) of subsection 
        (a), such contractor shall continue to pay applicable operation 
        and maintenance costs and other charges applicable to such 
        repayment contracts pursuant to the then-current rate-setting 
        policy and applicable law.
    (d) Certain Repayment Obligations Not Altered.--Implementation of 
the provisions of this section shall not alter the repayment obligation 
of any other long-term water service or repayment contractor receiving 
water from the Central Valley Project, or shift any costs that would 
otherwise have been properly assignable to any contractors absent this 
section, including operations and maintenance costs, construction 
costs, or other capitalized costs incurred after the date of enactment 
of this Act, to other such contractors.
    (e) Statutory Interpretation.--Nothing in this part shall be 
construed to affect the right of any long-term contractor to use a 
particular type of financing to make the payments required in paragraph 
(3)(A) or paragraph (4)(A) of subsection (a).
    (f) Definition of Treasury Rate.--For purposes of this section, 
``Treasury Rate'' shall be defined as the 20-year Constant Maturity 
Treasury rate published by the United States Department of the Treasury 
as of October 1, 2012.

 TITLE IV--BAY-DELTA WATERSHED WATER RIGHTS PRESERVATION AND PROTECTION

SEC. 401. WATER RIGHTS AND AREA-OF-ORIGIN PROTECTIONS.

    Notwithstanding the provisions of this Act, Federal reclamation 
law, or the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.)--
            (1) the Secretary of the Interior (``Secretary'') is 
        directed, in the operation of the Central Valley Project, to 
        strictly adhere to State water rights law governing water 
        rights priorities by honoring water rights senior to those 
        belonging to the Central Valley Project, regardless of the 
        source of priority;
            (2) the Secretary is directed, in the operation of the 
        Central Valley Project, to strictly adhere to and honor water 
        rights and other priorities that are obtained or exist pursuant 
        to the provisions of California Water Code sections 10505, 
        10505:5, 11128, 11460, and 11463; and sections 12200 to 12220, 
        inclusive; and
            (3) any action that affects the diversion of water or 
        involves the release of water from any Central Valley Project 
        water storage facility taken by the Secretary or the Secretary 
        of the Department of Commerce to conserve, enhance, recover, or 
        otherwise protect any species listed under the Endangered 
        Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) shall be applied 
        in a manner that is consistent with water right priorities 
        established by State law.

SEC. 402. SACRAMENTO RIVER SETTLEMENT CONTRACTS.

    In the implementation of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 
U.S.C. 1531 et seq.), in the Bay-Delta and on the Sacramento River, the 
Secretary and the Secretary of Commerce are directed to apply any 
limitations on the operation of the Central Valley Project or to 
formulate any ``reasonable prudent alternative'' associated with the 
operation of the Central Valley Project in a manner that strictly 
adheres to and applies the water rights priorities for ``Project 
Water'' and ``Base Supply'' provided for in the Sacramento River 
Settlement Contracts. Article 3(i) of the Sacramento River Settlement 
Contracts shall not be utilized by the United States as means to 
provide shortages to the Sacramento River Settlement Contracts that are 
different than those provided for in Article 5(a) of those contracts.

SEC. 403. SACRAMENTO RIVER WATERSHED WATER SERVICE CONTRACTORS.

    (a) In General.--Subject to subsection (b) and the absolute 
priority of the Sacramento River Settlement Contractors to Sacramento 
River supplies over Central Valley Project diversions and deliveries to 
other contractors, the Secretary is directed, in the operation of the 
Central Valley Project, to allocate water provided for irrigation 
purposes to existing Central Valley Project agricultural water service 
contractors within the Sacramento River Watershed in compliance with 
the following:
            (1) Not less than 100% of their contract quantities in a 
        ``Wet'' year.
            (2) Not less than 100% of their contract quantities in an 
        ``Above Normal'' year.
            (3) Not less than 100% of their contract quantities in a 
        ``Below Normal'' year.
            (4) Not less than 75% of their contract quantities in a 
        ``Dry'' year.
            (5) Not less than 50% of their contract quantities in a 
        ``Critically Dry'' year.
    (b) Protection of Municipal and Industrial Supplies.--Nothing in 
subsection (a) shall be deemed to (i) modify any provision of a water 
service contract that addresses municipal and industrial water shortage 
policies of the Secretary, (ii) affect or limit the authority of the 
Secretary to adopt or modify municipal and industrial water shortage 
policies, (iii) affect or limit the authority of the Secretary to 
implement municipal and industrial water shortage policies, or (iv) 
affect allocations to Central Valley Project municipal and industrial 
contractors pursuant to such policies. Neither subsection (a) nor the 
Secretary's implementation of subsection (a) shall constrain, govern or 
affect, directly or indirectly, the operations of the Central Valley 
Project's American River Division or any deliveries from that Division, 
its units or its facilities.
    (c) Definitions.--In this section:
            (1) The term ``existing Central Valley Project agricultural 
        water service contractors within the Sacramento River 
        Watershed'' means water service contractors within the Shasta, 
        Trinity, and Sacramento River Divisions of the Central Valley 
        Project, that have a water service contract in effect, on the 
        date of the enactment of this section, that provides water for 
        irrigation.
            (2) The year type terms used in subsection (a) have the 
        meaning given those year types in the Sacramento Valley Water 
        Year Type (40-30-30) Index.

SEC. 404. NO REDIRECTED ADVERSE IMPACTS.

    The Secretary shall insure that there are no redirected adverse 
water supply or fiscal impacts to those within the Sacramento River or 
San Joaquin River watershed or to the State Water Project arising from 
the Secretary's operation of the Central Valley Project to meet legal 
obligations imposed by or through any State or Federal agency, 
including, but not limited to those legal obligations emanating from 
the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) or this 
Act, or actions or activities implemented to meet the twin goals of 
improving water supply or addressing environmental needs of the Bay 
Delta.

                         TITLE V--MISCELLANEOUS

SEC. 501. PRECEDENT.

    Congress finds and declares that--
            (1) coordinated operations between the Central Valley 
        Project and the State Water Project, previously requested and 
        consented to by the State of California and the Federal 
        Government, require assertion of Federal supremacy to protect 
        existing water rights throughout the system; and
            (2) these circumstances are unique to California.
Therefore, nothing in this Act shall serve as precedent in any other 
State.

            Passed the House of Representatives February 29, 2012.

            Attest:
