                               RESOLUTION


 
   Supporting the designation of National Adult Education and Family 
                             Literacy Week.

Whereas the National Assessment of Adult Literacy reports that approximately 
        90,000,000 adults in the United States lack the literacy, numeracy, or 
        English language skills necessary to succeed at home, in the workplace, 
        and in society;
Whereas the literacy of the people of the United States is essential for the 
        social and economic well-being of the United States, and literacy allows 
        individuals to benefit from full participation in society;
Whereas the United States reaps the economic benefits from the efforts of 
        individuals to raise their literacy, numeracy, and English language 
        skills;
Whereas literacy and educational skills are a prerequisite to individuals 
        reaping the full benefit of opportunities in the United States;
Whereas the economy and the position of the United States in the world 
        marketplace depend on having a literate, skilled population;
Whereas the unemployment rate in the United States is highest among individuals 
        without a high school diploma or an equivalent credential, indicating 
        that education is key to economic recovery;
Whereas parents who are educated and read to their children directly impact the 
        educational success of their children;
Whereas parental involvement is a key predictor of a child's success, and the 
        level of parental involvement increases as the education level of the 
        parent increases;
Whereas parents in family literacy programs become more involved in their 
        children's education and gain the tools necessary to obtain a job or 
        find better employment;
Whereas, as a result of family literacy programs, children's lives become more 
        stable, and success in the classroom, and in all future endeavors, 
        becomes more likely;
Whereas adults need to be part of a long-term solution to the education 
        challenges of the United States;
Whereas many older people in the United States lack the reading, math, or 
        English language skills necessary to read a prescription and follow 
        medical instructions, endangering their lives and the lives of their 
        loved ones;
Whereas many individuals who are unemployed, underemployed, or receive public 
        assistance lack the literacy skills to obtain and keep a job to sustain 
        their family, continue their education, or participate in job training 
        programs;
Whereas many high school dropouts do not have the literacy skills to complete 
        their education, transition to postsecondary education or career and 
        technical training, or become employed;
Whereas a large percentage of individuals in prison have low educational skills, 
        and prisoners without educational skills are more likely to return to 
        prison once released;
Whereas many immigrants to the United States do not have the literacy skills 
        necessary to succeed in the United States;
Whereas National Adult Education and Family Literacy week highlights the need to 
        ensure that each and every citizen has the necessary literacy and 
        educational skills to succeed at home, at work, and in society; and
Whereas the week beginning September 12, 2011, would be an appropriate week to 
        designate as National Adult Education and Family Literacy Week: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) supports the designation of National Adult Education 
        and Family Literacy Week, including raising public awareness 
        about the importance of adult education, workforce skills, and 
        family literacy;
            (2) encourages people across the United States to support 
        programs to assist those in need of adult education, workforce 
        skills upgrading, and family literacy programs; and
            (3) recognizes the importance of adult education, workforce 
        skills, and family literacy programs, and calls upon public, 
        private, and non-profit stakeholders to support increased 
        access to adult education and family literacy programs to 
        ensure a literate society.
