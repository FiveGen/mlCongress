  Mr. Whitehouse (for himself, Mr. Schumer, Mrs. Gillibrand, and Mr.

                               RESOLUTION


 
  Recognizing the life and work of war correspondent Marie Colvin and 
               other courageous journalists in war zones.

Whereas The Sunday Times reporter Marie Colvin was killed during the shelling of 
        a makeshift media center in the Baba Amr neighborhood of the besieged 
        Syrian city of Homs on February 22, 2012, along with French photographer 
        Remi Ochlik;
Whereas Ms. Colvin leaves behind a beloved family where she grew up in the State 
        of New York, was educated and began her journalistic career in the 
        United States, and throughout her career as one of the foremost war 
        correspondents of her generation exemplified American values of 
        humanity, accountability, decency, transparency, and courage;
Whereas Ms. Colvin worked with relentless bravery to report on the recent 
        uprising in Syria and to expose crimes against humanity, human-rights 
        violations, and the ravages of war in conflict zones throughout the 
        world, including the Balkans, the Chechen Republic, Libya, and Sri 
        Lanka, where she was seriously wounded and lost vision in 1 eye;
Whereas Ms. Colvin shed light on human-rights violations through her courageous 
        reporting on how these conflicts affected the lives of individuals;
Whereas the actions of Ms. Colvin in Timor-Leste are widely credited with 
        averting a massacre;
Whereas Ms. Colvin said, ``Covering a war means going to places torn by chaos, 
        destruction, and death, and trying to bear witness. It means trying to 
        find the truth in a sandstorm of propaganda when armies, tribes or 
        terrorists clash. And yes, it means taking risks, not just for yourself 
        but often for the people who work closely with you.'';
Whereas the work of Ms. Colvin exemplifies the best qualities of journalism;
Whereas Ms. Colvin was awarded the 2000 Courage in Journalism Award from the 
        International Women's Media Foundation for behind-the-lines action in 
        Kosovo and the Chechen Republic, twice named Foreign Reporter of the 
        Year at the British Press Awards, named the Journalist of the Year by 
        the Foreign Press Association in 2000, and named Woman Journalist of the 
        Year by the Foreign Press Association in 2010; and
Whereas Ms. Colvin and brave journalists have lost their lives serving as the 
        conscience of the world: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) extends its sympathy to the families of Ms. Colvin and 
        other reporters who have died reporting from conflict zones;
            (2) recognizes the bravery of Ms. Colvin and other 
        correspondents and photographers who have lost their lives 
        while exposing the truth;
            (3) calls on the world community to honor the memories of 
        Ms. Colvin and other reporters; and
            (4) calls on the government of Syria to halt the brutal 
        attacks against the people of Syria and to respect their human 
        rights.
                                 <all>
