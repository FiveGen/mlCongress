Whereas, on December 14, 2012, a mass shooting took place at Sandy Hook

Whereas the people of the United States mourn the 26 innocent lives, including 
        those of 20 children, that have been lost at Sandy Hook Elementary

Whereas the people of the United States will always remember the victims of the

        stand in solidarity with the survivors; and
Whereas the quick action of law enforcement officials and other first responders 
        prevented additional losses of life: Now, therefore, be it

            (3) honors the selfless, dedicated service of--
                    (A) the teachers, school administrators, school 
                support staff, medical professionals, and others in the 
                greater Newtown community;
                    (B) the emergency response teams and law 
                enforcement officials who responded to the attack; and
