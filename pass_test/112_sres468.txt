                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing the sense of the Senate with respect to childhood stroke and 
   recognizing May as ``National Pediatric Stroke Awareness Month''.

Whereas a stroke, also known as a cerebrovascular accident, is an acute 
        neurologic injury that occurs when the blood supply to a part of the 
        brain is interrupted by a clot in the artery or a burst of the artery;
Whereas a stroke is a medical emergency that can cause permanent neurologic 
        damage or even death if not promptly diagnosed and treated;
Whereas stroke occurs in approximately 1 out of every 4,000 live births, and the 
        risk of stroke from birth through age 18 is nearly 11 out of every 
        100,000 children per year;
Whereas an individual can have a stroke before birth;
Whereas stroke is among the top 10 causes of death for children in the United 
        States;
Whereas between 20 percent and 40 percent of children who suffer a stroke die as 
        a result;
Whereas stroke recurs in 20 percent of children who have experienced a stroke;
Whereas the death rate for children who experience a stroke before the age of 1 
        year is the highest out of all age groups;
Whereas the average time from onset of symptoms to diagnosis of stroke is 24 
        hours, putting many affected children outside the window of 3 hours for 
        the most successful treatment;
Whereas between 50 and 85 percent of infants and children who have a pediatric 
        stroke will have serious, permanent neurological disabilities, including 
        paralysis, seizures, speech and vision problems, and attention, 
        learning, and behavioral difficulties;
Whereas those disabilities may require ongoing physical therapy and surgeries;
Whereas the permanent health concerns and treatments resulting from strokes that 
        occur during childhood and young adulthood have a considerable impact on 
        children, families, and society;
Whereas very little is known about the cause, treatment, and prevention of 
        pediatric stroke;
Whereas medical research is the only means by which the citizens of the United 
        States can identify and develop effective treatment and prevention 
        strategies for pediatric stroke; and
Whereas early diagnosis and treatment of pediatric stroke greatly improves the 
        chances that the affected child will recover and not experience a 
        recurrence: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) acknowledges May as ``National Pediatric Stroke 
        Awareness Month'';
            (2) urges the people of the United States to support the 
        efforts, programs, services, and advocacy of organizations that 
        work to enhance public awareness of childhood stroke;
            (3) supports the work of the National Institutes of Health 
        in pursuit of medical progress on the matter of pediatric 
        stroke; and
            (4) urges continued coordination and cooperation between 
        government, researchers, families, and the public to improve 
        treatments and prognoses for children who suffer strokes.
                                 <all>
