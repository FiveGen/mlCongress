                               RESOLUTION


 
  Recognizing the importance of cancer research and the contributions 
  made by scientists and clinicians across the United States who are 
 dedicated to finding a cure for cancer, and designating May 2011, as 
                  ``National Cancer Research Month''.

Whereas in 2011, cancer remains one of the most pressing public health concerns 
        in the United States, with 1,500,000 Americans expected to be diagnosed 
        with cancer and more than 500,000 expected to die from the disease;
Whereas the term ``cancer'' refers to more than 200 diseases that collectively 
        represent the leading cause of death for Americans under age 85, and the 
        second leading cause of death for Americans overall;
Whereas the national investment in cancer research has yielded substantial 
        returns in research advances and lives saved, with a scholarly estimate 
        that every 1 percent decline in cancer mortality saves the United States 
        economy $500,000,000,000;
Whereas advancements in the understanding of the causes, mechanisms, diagnosis, 
        treatment, and prevention of cancer have led to cures for many types of 
        cancers and have converted other types of cancers into manageable 
        chronic conditions;
Whereas the 5-year survival rate for all cancers has improved during the 30 
        years prior to the date of approval of this resolution to more than 65 
        percent, and as of 2011, there are more than 12,000,000 cancer survivors 
        living in the United States;
Whereas partnerships with research scientists and the general public, survivors 
        and patient advocates, philanthropic organizations, industry, and 
        Federal, State, and local governments have led to advanced 
        breakthroughs, early detection tools that have increased survival rates, 
        and a better quality of life for cancer survivors; and
Whereas advances in cancer research have had significant implications for the 
        treatment of other costly diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, 
        Alzheimer's disease, HIV/AIDS, and macular degeneration: Now, therefore, 
        be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes the importance of cancer research and the 
        invaluable contributions of the researchers in the United 
        States and worldwide and who are dedicated to reversing the 
        cancer epidemic;
            (2) designates May 2011 as ``National Cancer Research 
        Month''; and
            (3) supports efforts to make cancer research a national and 
        international priority so that one day the more than 200 
        diseases known as cancer are eliminated.
                                 <all>
