Whereas the Federal Executive Boards were established through a presidential 
        directive signed by President John F. Kennedy in 1961;
Whereas, the Federal Executive Boards increase effectiveness and economy of 
        Federal agencies through coordination of local approaches to national 
        programs and shared management needs;
Whereas, the Federal Executive Boards serve over 780,000 Federal civilian 
        employees in 28 locations across the Nation;
Whereas, the Federal Executive Boards provide a forum for the exchange of 
        information between Washington, D.C. and agencies in the field about 
        programs, management methods, and administrative issues;
Whereas, the Federal Executive Boards improve the continuity of Government 
        operations by facilitating planning and coordination among local Federal 
        agencies;
Whereas, the Federal Executive Boards increase the efficiency of Federal 
        spending through cost-avoidance on coordinated training and alternative 
        dispute resolution programs;
Whereas, the Federal Executive Boards serve as the Federal point of contact for 
        intergovernmental collaboration and community outreach in their locales;
Whereas commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Federal Executive Boards will 
        recognize members and staff of Federal Executive Boards for their 
        unyielding dedication and commitment to public service, as well as the 
        Federal agencies whose support over the years has helped Federal 
        Executive Boards provide Federal employees with low-cost training, 
        emergency preparedness plans, and performance recognition through 
        interagency awards events: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--

        50th anniversary of Federal Executive Boards with appropriate 
        ceremonies and activities.
