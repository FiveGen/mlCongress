        testimonies, the preponderance of which presents a pattern of systemic 
        violations of . . . fundamental human rights'' in Iran, and expressed 
        concern regarding reports of ``human and civil rights violations'' 
        against minority groups, including ``the Bahai community, which, despite

        eliminate discrimination against, and exclusion of . . . members of the

        in the county of Shahriar in the province of Tehran, instructing the

        violations of human rights and religious freedom in Iran'': Now,

            Attest:

                                                                          Clerk.
