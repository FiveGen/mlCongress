                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing the sense of the Senate relating to the 150th anniversary of 
the admittance of the State of Kansas to the United States as the 34th 
                                 State.

Whereas January 29, 2011, marks the 150th anniversary of the admittance to the 
        State of Kansas to the United States as the 34th State;
Whereas the sesquicentennial of the statehood of the State of Kansas is cause 
        for celebration and reflection;
Whereas the name Kansas is derived from the Kansa Indians who, among many other 
        Indian tribes, have inhabited the plains of the United States for 
        centuries;
Whereas Kansas received official recognition as a territory in 1854;
Whereas the territorial years of Kansas, commonly known as ``Bleeding Kansas'', 
        were marked by violence and bloodshed over whether Kansas would join the 
        United States as a State that permitted slavery;
Whereas the territorial population of Kansas was committed to the ideals of 
        personal freedom and individual liberty, which led to armed conflict 
        with neighboring regions;
Whereas the battle between pro-freedom and pro-slavery interests over the future 
        of Kansas were fought politically and violently in both Kansas and 
        Washington, District of Columbia;
Whereas Kansas was admitted to the United States as a free State on January 29, 
        1861, under President James Buchanan following a debate that served as a 
        factor in the outbreak of the Civil War;
Whereas the legislature of the State of Kansas convened for the first time in 
        March 1861, only a month prior to the commencement of the Civil War with 
        the firing on Fort Sumter in the State of South Carolina in April 1861;
Whereas two-thirds of the able-bodied males in the State of Kansas served in the 
        Union Army over the course of the Civil War;
Whereas the State of Kansas was born in the midst of blood and battle, has 
        established itself as a national leader in agriculture and aviation, and 
        is a key contributor to the culture of the United States;
Whereas Kansas agricultural producers produce food, fuel, and fiber that is used 
        throughout the United States and exported across the globe;
Whereas Kansas aircraft manufacturers have led the world in producing quality 
        aircraft since the early days of aviation;
Whereas throughout the State and across generations, the people of the State of 
        Kansas employ a work ethic and sense of duty befitting the American 
        Dream, none better exemplify this than President Dwight D. Eisenhower, 
        the boy who rose from humble beginnings to lead as Supreme Allied 
        Commander in World War II and later serve as the 34th President of the 
        United States;
Whereas from the days of the ``Bleeding Kansas'' border wars through the current 
        deployments in the Middle East, patriotic people of the State of Kansas 
        have answered the call of duty to fight for the United States and the 
        cause of liberty, including Senator Bob Dole who was wounded as a young 
        infantry officer in World War II and later served as Senate Majority 
        Leader and the Republican Nominee for President of the United States in 
        1996;
Whereas the State of Kansas continues its proud military tradition by supporting 
        troops and their families in the National Guard in towns across the 
        State and at Fort Riley, McConnell Air Force Base, and the Army Staff 
        and Command College in Leavenworth; and
Whereas the motto of the State of Kansas, ``Ad Astra per Aspera,'' which means 
        ``To the Stars through Difficulty,'' pays respect to the turbulent past 
        of the State of Kansas, while remaining hopeful about the future: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That--
            (1) it is the sense of the Senate that--
                    (A) the people of the United States should observe 
                and celebrate the 150th anniversary of the admittance 
                of the State of Kansas to the United States as the 34th 
                State;
                    (B) the people of the State of Kansas should--
                            (i) be honored for their pioneering spirit 
                        and innovations; and
                            (ii) reflect on the distinguished past of 
                        the State and look forward to a promising 
                        future; and
                    (C) there is no place like home; and
            (2) the Senate respectfully requests the Secretary of the 
        Senate to transmit to the Governor of the State of Kansas an 
        enrolled copy of this resolution for appropriate display.
                                 <all>
