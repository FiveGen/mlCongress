                               RESOLUTION


 
      To authorize testimony, documents and legal representation.

Whereas, in the case of Social Security Administration v. Charlotte N. White, 
        No. CB-75211-11-0004-T-1, pending before the Merit Systems Protection 
        Board, a subpoena for deposition testimony and document production has 
        been served on Sherae Hunter and a subpoena for deposition testimony has 
        been served on Wes Kungel, both employees in the Office of Senator Mary 
        L. Landrieu;
Whereas, pursuant to sections 703(a) and 704(a)(2) of the Ethics in Government 
        Act of 1978, 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec.  288b(a) and 288c(a)(2), the Senate may 
        direct its counsel to represent employees of the Senate with respect to 
        any subpoena, order, or request for testimony relating to their official 
        responsibilities;
Whereas, by the privileges of the Senate of the United States and Rule XI of the 
        Standing Rules of the Senate, no evidence under the control or in the 
        possession of the Senate may, by the judicial or administrative process, 
        be taken from such control or possession but by permission of the 
        Senate;
Whereas, when it appears that evidence under the control or in the possession of 
        the Senate may promote the administration of justice, the Senate will 
        take such action as will promote the ends of justice consistent with the 
        privileges of the Senate: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That Sherae Hunter and Wes Kungel are authorized to 
testify and produce documents in Social Security Administration v. 
Charlotte N. White, except concerning matters for which a privilege 
should be asserted.
    Sec. 2.  The Senate Legal Counsel is authorized to represent Sherae 
Hunter, Wes Kungel, and any other individual in Senator Landrieu's 
office in this matter.
                                 <all>
