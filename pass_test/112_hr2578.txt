            (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary 
        of the Interior.

SEC. 303. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1)(A) in 1971, Congress enacted the Alaska Native Claims 
        Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) to recognize and settle 
        the aboriginal claims of Alaska Natives to land historically 
        used by Alaska Natives for traditional, cultural, and spiritual 
        purposes; and
            (B) that Act declared that the land settlement ``should be 
        accomplished rapidly, with certainty, in conformity with the 
        real economic and social needs of Natives'';
            (2) the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 
        et seq.)--
                    (A) authorized the distribution of approximately 
                $1,000,000,000 and 44,000,000 acres of land to Alaska 
                Natives; and
                    (B) provided for the establishment of Native 
                Corporations to receive and manage the funds and that 
                land to meet the cultural, social, and economic needs 
                of Native shareholders;
            (3) under section 12 of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement 
        Act (43 U.S.C. 1611), each Regional Corporation, other than 
        Sealaska (the Regional Corporation for southeast Alaska), was 
        authorized to receive a share of land based on the proportion 
        that the number of Alaska Native shareholders residing in the 
        region of the Regional Corporation bore to the total number of 
        Alaska Native shareholders, or the relative size of the area to 
        which the Regional Corporation had an aboriginal land claim 
        bore to the size of the area to which all Regional Corporations 
        had aboriginal land claims;
            (4)(A) Sealaska, the Regional Corporation for southeast 
        Alaska, 1 of the Regional Corporations with the largest number 
        of Alaska Native shareholders, with more than 21 percent of all 
        original Alaska Native shareholders, received less than 1 
        percent of the lands set aside for Alaska Natives, and received 
        no land under section 12 of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement 
        Act (43 U.S.C. 1611);
            (B) the Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska was 1 of 
        the entities representing the Alaska Natives of southeast 
        Alaska before the date of enactment of the Alaska Native Claims 
        Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.); and
            (C) Sealaska did not receive land in proportion to the 
        number of Alaska Native shareholders, or in proportion to the 
        size of the area to which Sealaska had an aboriginal land 
        claim, in part because of a United States Court of Claims cash 
        settlement to the Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska in 
        1968 for land previously taken to create the Tongass National 
        Forest and Glacier Bay National Monument;
            (5) the 1968 Court of Claims cash settlement of $7,500,000 
        did not--
                    (A) adequately compensate the Alaska Natives of 
                southeast Alaska for the significant quantity of land 
                and resources lost as a result of the creation of the 
                Tongass National Forest and Glacier Bay National 
                Monument or other losses of land and resources; or
                    (B) justify the significant disparate treatment of 
                Sealaska under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act 
                (43 U.S.C. 1611) in 1971;
            (6)(A) while each other Regional Corporation received a 
        significant quantity of land under sections 12 and 14 of the 
        Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1611, 1613), 
        Sealaska only received land under section 14(h) of that Act (43 
        U.S.C. 1613(h));
            (B) section 14(h) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement 
        Act (43 U.S.C. 1613(h)) authorized the Secretary to withdraw 
        and convey 2,000,000-acres of ``unreserved and unappropriated'' 
        public lands in Alaska from which Alaska Native selections 
        could be made for historic sites, cemetery sites, Urban 
        Corporation land, Native group land, and Native Allotments;
            (C) under section 14(h)(8) of the Alaska Native Claims 
        Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1613(h)(8)), after selections are 
        made under paragraphs (1) through (7) of that section, the land 
        remaining in the 2,000,000-acre land pool is allocated based on 
        the proportion that the original Alaska Native shareholder 
        population of a Regional Corporation bore to the original 
        Alaska Native shareholder population of all Regional 
        Corporations;
            (D) the only Native land entitlement of Sealaska derives 
        from a proportion of leftover land remaining from the 
        2,000,000-acre land pool, estimated as of the date of enactment 
        of this Act at approximately 1,700,000 acres;
            (E) because at the time of enactment of the Alaska Native 
        Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) all public land 
        in the Tongass National Forest had been reserved for purposes 
        of creating the national forest, the Secretary was not able to 
        withdraw any public land in the Tongass National Forest for 
        selection by and conveyance to Sealaska;
            (F) at the time of enactment of the Alaska Native Claims 
        Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) other public lands in 
        southeast Alaska not located in the Tongass National Forest 
        were not suitable for selection by and conveyance to Sealaska 
        because such lands were located in Glacier Bay National 
        Monument, were included in a withdrawal effected pursuant to 
        section 17(d)(2) of that Act (43 U.S.C. 1616(d)(2)) and slated 
        to become part of the Wrangell-St. Elias National Park, or 
        essentially consisted of mountain tops;
            (G) Sealaska in 1975 requested that Congress amend the 
        Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) to 
        permit the Regional Corporation to select lands inside of the 
        withdrawal areas established for southeast Alaska Native 
        villages under section 16 of that Act (43 U.S.C. 1615); and
            (H) in 1976, Congress amended section 16 of the Alaska 
        Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1615) to allow Sealaska 
        to select lands under section 14(h)(8) of that Act (43 U.S.C. 
        1613(h)(8)) from land located inside, rather than outside, the 
        withdrawal areas established for southeast Alaska Native 
        villages;
            (7) the 10 Alaska Native village withdrawal areas in 
        southeast Alaska surround the Alaska Native communities of 
        Yakutat, Hoonah, Angoon, Kake, Kasaan, Klawock, Craig, 
        Hydaburg, Klukwan, and Saxman;
            (8)(A) the existing conveyance requirements of the Alaska 
        Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) for 
        southeast Alaska limit the land eligible for conveyance to 
        Sealaska to the original withdrawal areas surrounding 10 Alaska 
        Native villages in southeast Alaska, which precludes Sealaska 
        from selecting land located--
                    (i) in any withdrawal area established for the 
                Urban Corporations for Sitka and Juneau, Alaska; or
                    (ii) outside the 10 Alaska Native village 
                withdrawal areas; and
            (B) unlike other Regional Corporations, Sealaska is not 
        authorized to request land located outside the withdrawal areas 
        described in subparagraph (A) if the withdrawal areas are 
        insufficient to complete the land entitlement of Sealaska under 
        the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et 
        seq.);
            (9)(A) the deadline for applications for selection of 
        cemetery sites and historic places on land outside withdrawal 
        areas established under section 14 of the Alaska Native Claims 
        Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1613) was July 1, 1976;
            (B)(i) as of that date, the Bureau of Land Management 
        notified Sealaska that the total entitlement of Sealaska would 
        be approximately 200,000 acres; and
            (ii) Sealaska made entitlement allocation decisions for 
        cultural sites and economic development sites based on that 
        original estimate; and
            (C) as a result of the Alaska Land Transfer Acceleration 
        Act (Public Law 108-452; 118 Stat. 3575) and subsequent related 
        determinations and actions of the Bureau of Land Management, it 
        became clear within the last decade that Sealaska will receive 
        significantly more than 200,000 acres pursuant to the Alaska 
        Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.);
            (10) in light of the revised Bureau of Land Management 
        estimate of the total number of acres that Sealaska will 
        receive pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 
        U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), and in consultation with Members of 
        Alaska's congressional delegation, Sealaska and its 
        shareholders believe that it is appropriate to allocate more of 
        the entitlement of Sealaska to--
                    (A) the acquisition of places of sacred, cultural, 
                traditional, and historical significance;
                    (B) the acquisition of sites with traditional and 
                recreational use value and sites suitable for renewable 
                energy development; and
                    (C) the acquisition of lands that are not within 
                the watersheds of Native and non-Native communities and 
                are suitable economically and environmentally for 
                natural resource development;
            (11)(A) pursuant to section 11(a)(1) of the Alaska Native 
        Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1610(a)(1)), Sealaska was not 
        authorized to select under section 14(h)(1) of that Act (43 
        U.S.C. 1613(h)(1)) any site within Glacier Bay National Park, 
        despite the abundance of cultural sites within that Park;
            (B) Sealaska seeks cooperative agreements to ensure that 
        cultural sites within Glacier Bay National Park are subject to 
        cooperative management by Sealaska, Village and Urban 
        Corporations, and federally recognized tribes with ties to the 
        cultural sites and history of the Park; and
            (C) Congress recognizes that there is an existing 
        Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Park Service and 
        the Hoonah Indian Association, and does not intend to 
        circumvent the MOU; rather the intent is to ensure that this 
        and similar mechanisms for cooperative management in Glacier 
        Bay are required by law;
            (12)(A) the cemetery sites and historic places conveyed to 
        Sealaska pursuant to section 14(h)(1) of the Alaska Native 
        Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1613(h)(1)) are subject to a 
        restrictive covenant not required by the Alaska Native Claims 
        Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) that hinders the 
        ability of Sealaska to use the sites for cultural, educational, 
        or research purposes for Alaska Natives and others;
            (B) historic sites managed by the Forest Service are not 
        subject to the limitations referred to in subparagraph (A); and
            (C) Alaska Natives of southeast Alaska should be permitted 
        to use cemetery sites and historic places in a manner that is--
                    (i) consistent with the sacred, cultural, 
                traditional, or historic nature of the site; and
                    (ii) not inconsistent with the management plans for 
                adjacent public land;
            (13) 44 percent (820,000 acres) of the 10 Alaska Native 
        village withdrawal areas established under the Alaska Native 
        Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) described in 
        paragraphs (7) and (8) are composed of salt water and not 
        available for selection;
            (14) of land subject to the selection rights of Sealaska, 
        110,000 acres are encumbered by gubernatorial consent 
        requirements under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 
        U.S.C. 1601 et seq.);
            (15) in each withdrawal area, there exist factors that 
        limit the ability of Sealaska to select sufficient land, and, 
        in particular, economically viable land, to fulfill the land 
        entitlement of Sealaska, including factors such as--
                    (A) with respect to the Yakutat withdrawal area--
                            (i) 46 percent of the area is salt water;
                            (ii) 10 sections (6,400 acres) around the 
                        Situk Lake were restricted from selection, with 
                        no consideration provided for the restriction; 
                        and
                            (iii)(I) 70,000 acres are subject to a 
                        gubernatorial consent requirement before 
                        selection; and
                            (II) Sealaska received no consideration 
                        with respect to the consent restriction;
                    (B) with respect to the Hoonah withdrawal area, 51 
                percent of the area is salt water;
                    (C) with respect to the Angoon withdrawal area--
                            (i) 120,000 acres of the area is salt 
                        water;
                            (ii) Sealaska received no consideration 
                        regarding the prohibition on selecting land 
                        from the 80,000 acres located within the 
                        Admiralty Island National Monument; and
                            (iii)(I) the Village Corporation for Angoon 
                        was allowed to select land located outside the 
                        withdrawal area on Prince of Wales Island, 
                        subject to the condition that the Village 
                        Corporation shall not select land located on 
                        Admiralty Island; but
                            (II) no alternative land adjacent to the 
                        out-of-withdrawal land of the Village 
                        Corporation was made available for selection by 
                        Sealaska;
                    (D) with respect to the Kake withdrawal area--
                            (i) 64 percent of the area is salt water; 
                        and
                            (ii) extensive timber harvesting by the 
                        Forest Service occurred in the area before 1971 
                        that significantly reduced the value of land 
                        available for selection by, and conveyance to, 
                        Sealaska;
                    (E) with respect to the Kasaan withdrawal area--
                            (i) 54 percent of the area is salt water; 
                        and
                            (ii) the Forest Service previously 
                        harvested in the area;
                    (F) with respect to the Klawock withdrawal area--
                            (i) the area consists of only 5 townships, 
                        as compared to the usual withdrawal area of 9 
                        townships, because of the proximity of the 
                        Klawock withdrawal area to the Village of 
                        Craig, which reduces the selection area by 
                        92,160 acres; and
                            (ii) the Klawock and Craig withdrawal areas 
                        are 35 percent salt water;
                    (G) with respect to the Craig withdrawal area, the 
                withdrawal area consists of only 6 townships, as 
                compared to the usual withdrawal area of 9 townships, 
                because of the proximity of the Craig withdrawal area 
                to the Village of Klawock, which reduces the selection 
                area by 69,120 acres;
                    (H) with respect to the Hydaburg withdrawal area--
                            (i) 36 percent of the area is salt water; 
                        and
                            (ii) Sealaska received no consideration 
                        under the Haida Land Exchange Act of 1986 
                        (Public Law No. 99-664; 100 Stat. 4303) for 
                        relinquishing selection rights to land within 
                        the withdrawal area that the Haida Corporation 
                        exchanged to the Forest Service;
                    (I) with respect to the Klukwan withdrawal area--
                            (i) 27 percent of the area is salt water; 
                        and
                            (ii) the withdrawal area is only 70,000 
                        acres, as compared to the usual withdrawal area 
                        of 207,360 acres, which reduces the selection 
                        area by 137,360 acres; and
                    (J) with respect to the Saxman withdrawal area--
                            (i) 29 percent of the area is salt water;
                            (ii) Sealaska received no consideration for 
                        the 50,576 acres within the withdrawal area 
                        adjacent to the first-class city of Ketchikan 
                        that were excluded from selection;
                            (iii) Sealaska received no consideration 
                        with respect to the 1977 amendment to the 
                        Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 
                        1601 et seq.) requiring gubernatorial consent 
                        for selection of 58,000 acres in that area; and
                            (iv) 23,888 acres are located within the 
                        Annette Island Indian Reservation for the 
                        Metlakatla Indian Tribe and are not available 
                        for selection;
            (16) the selection limitations and guidelines applicable to 
        Sealaska under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 
        U.S.C. 1601 et seq.)--
                    (A) are inequitable and inconsistent with the 
                purposes of that Act because there is insufficient land 
                remaining in the withdrawal areas to meet the 
                traditional, cultural, and socioeconomic needs of the 
                shareholders of Sealaska; and
                    (B) make it difficult for Sealaska to select--
                            (i) places of sacred, cultural, 
                        traditional, and historical significance;
                            (ii) sites with traditional and recreation 
                        use value and sites suitable for renewable 
                        energy development; and
                            (iii) lands that meet the real economic 
                        needs of the shareholders of Sealaska;
            (17) unless Sealaska is allowed to select land outside 
        designated withdrawal areas in southeast Alaska, Sealaska will 
        not be able to--
                    (A) complete the land entitlement selections of 
                Sealaska under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act 
                (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) in a manner that meets the 
                cultural, social, and economic needs of Native 
                shareholders;
                    (B) avoid land selections in watersheds that are 
                the exclusive drinking water supply for regional 
                communities, support world class salmon streams, have 
                been identified as important habitat, or would 
                otherwise be managed by the Forest Service as roadless 
                and old growth forest reserves;
                    (C) secure ownership of places of sacred, cultural, 
                traditional, and historical importance to the Alaska 
                Natives of southeast Alaska; and
                    (D) continue to support forestry jobs and economic 
                opportunities for Alaska Natives and other residents of 
                rural southeast Alaska;
            (18)(A) the rate of unemployment in southeast Alaska 
        exceeds the statewide rate of unemployment on a non-seasonally 
        adjusted basis;
            (B) in January 2011, the Alaska Department of Labor and 
        Workforce Development reported the unemployment rate for the 
        Prince of Wales--Outer Ketchikan census area at approximately 
        16.2 percent;
            (C) in October 2007, the Alaska Department of Labor and 
        Workforce Development projected population losses between 1996 
        and 2030 for the Prince of Wales--Outer Ketchikan census area 
        at 56.6 percent;
            (D) official unemployment rates severely underreport the 
        actual level of regional unemployment, particularly in Native 
        villages; and
            (E) additional job losses will exacerbate outmigration from 
        Native and non-Native communities in southeast Alaska;
            (19) Sealaska has played, and is expected to continue to 
        play, a significant role in the health of the southeast Alaska 
        economy;
            (20) despite the small land base of Sealaska as compared to 
        other Regional Corporations (less than 1 percent of the total 
        quantity of land allocated pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims 
        Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.)), Sealaska has--
                    (A) provided considerable benefits to Alaska Native 
                shareholders;
                    (B) supported hundreds of jobs for Alaska Native 
                shareholders and non-shareholders in southeast Alaska 
                for more than 30 years; and
                    (C) been a significant economic force in southeast 
                Alaska;
            (21) pursuant to the revenue sharing provisions of section 
        7(i) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 
        1606(i)), Sealaska has distributed more than $300,000,000 
        during the period beginning on January 1, 1971, and ending on 
        December 31, 2005, to Native Corporations throughout the State 
        of Alaska from the development of natural resources, which 
        accounts for 42 percent of the total revenues shared under that 
        section during that period;
            (22) resource development operations maintained by 
        Sealaska--
                    (A) support hundreds of jobs in the southeast 
                Alaska region;
                    (B) make timber available to local and domestic 
                sawmills and other wood products businesses such as 
                guitar manufacturers;
                    (C) support firewood programs for local 
                communities;
                    (D) support maintenance of roads utilized by local 
                communities for subsistence and recreation uses;
                    (E) support development of new biomass energy 
                opportunities in southeast Alaska, reducing dependence 
                on high-cost diesel fuel for the generation of energy;
                    (F) provide start-up capital for innovative 
                business models in southeast Alaska that create new 
                opportunities for non-timber economic development in 
                the region, including support for renewable biomass 
                initiatives, Alaska Native artisans, and rural 
                mariculture farming; and
                    (G) support Native education and cultural and 
                language preservation activities;
            (23) if the resource development operations of Sealaska 
        cease on land appropriate for those operations, there will be a 
        significant negative impact on--
                    (A) southeast Alaska Native shareholders;
                    (B) the cultural preservation activities of 
                Sealaska;
                    (C) the economy of southeast Alaska; and
                    (D) the Alaska Native community that benefits from 
                the revenue-sharing requirements under the Alaska 
                Native claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.);
            (24) it is critical that the remaining land entitlement 
        conveyances to Sealaska under the Alaska Native Claims 
        Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) are fulfilled to 
        continue to meet the economic, social, and cultural needs of 
        the Alaska Native shareholders of southeast Alaska and the 
        Alaska Native community throughout Alaska;
            (25) in order to realize cultural preservation goals while 
        also diversifying economic opportunities, Sealaska should be 
        authorized to select and receive conveyance of--
                    (A) sacred, cultural, traditional, and historic 
                sites and other places of traditional cultural 
                significance, including traditional and customary trade 
                and migration routes, to facilitate the perpetuation 
                and preservation of Alaska Native culture and history;
                    (B) other sites with traditional and recreation use 
                value and sites suitable for renewable energy 
                development to facilitate appropriate tourism and 
                outdoor recreation enterprises and renewable energy 
                development for rural southeast Alaska communities; and
                    (C) lands that are suitable economically and 
                environmentally for natural resource development;
            (26) on completion of the conveyances of land of Sealaska 
        to fulfill the full land entitlement of Sealaska under the 
        Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), 
        the encumbrances on 327,000 acres of Federal land created by 
        the withdrawal of land for selection by Native Corporations in 
        southeast Alaska should be removed, which will facilitate 
        thorough and complete planning and efficient management 
        relating to national forest land in southeast Alaska by the 
        Forest Service;
            (27) although the Tribal Forest Protection Act (25 U.S.C. 
        3101 note; Public Law 108-278) defines the term ``Indian 
        tribe'' to include Indian tribes under section 4 of the Indian 
        Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 
        450b), a term which includes ``any Alaska Native village or 
        regional or village corporation as defined in or established 
        pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act * * *'', 
        the Tribal Forest Protection Act does not define the term 
        ``Indian forest land or rangeland'' to include lands owned by 
        Alaska Native Corporations, including Sealaska, which are the 
        primary Indian forest land owners in Alaska, and therefore, the 
        Tribal Forest Protection Act should be amended in a manner that 
        will--
                    (A) permit Native Corporations, including Sealaska, 
                as Indian forest land owners in Alaska, to work with 
                the Secretary of Agriculture under the Tribal Forest 
                Protection Act to address forest fire and insect 
                infestation issues, including the spread of the spruce 
                bark beetle in southeast and southcentral Alaska, which 
                threaten the health of the Native forestlands; and
                    (B) ensure that Native Corporations, including 
                Sealaska, can participate in programs administered by 
                the Secretary of Agriculture under the Tribal Forest 
                Protection Act without including Native Corporations 
                under the definition in that Act of ``Indian forest 
                land or rangeland'' or otherwise amending that Act in a 
                manner that validates, invalidates, or otherwise 
                affects any claim regarding the existence of Indian 
                country in the State of Alaska; and
            (28) the National Historic Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 470 
        et seq.) defines the term ``Indian tribe'' to include any 
        ``Native village, Regional Corporation or Village Corporation, 
        as those terms are defined in section 3 of the Alaska Native 
        Claims Settlement Act'' but does not define the term ``Tribal 
        lands'' to include lands owned by Alaska Native Corporations, 
        thereby excluding from the National Historic Preservation Act 
        cemetery sites and historical places transferred to Native 
        Corporations, including Sealaska, pursuant to the Alaska Native 
        Claims Settlement Act, and therefore, the National Historic 
        Preservation Act should be amended in a manner that will--

             TITLE VI--NORTH CASCADES NATIONAL PARK ACCESS

SEC. 601. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds as follows:
            (1) In 1988, 93 percent of the North Cascades National Park 
        Complex was designated the Stephen Mather Wilderness.
            (2) A road corridor was deliberately excluded from the 
        wilderness designation to provide for the continued use and 
        maintenance of the upper Stehekin Valley Road.
            (3) The upper Stehekin Valley Road provides access to 
        Stephen Mather Wilderness trailheads and North Cascades 
        National Park from the Lake Chelan National Recreation Area.
            (4) Record flooding in 1995 and again in 2003 caused severe 
        damage to the upper Stehekin Valley Road and led to the closure 
        of a 9.9-mile section of the road between Car Wash Falls and 
        Cottonwood Camp.
            (5) The National Park Service currently does not have the 
        flexibility to rebuild the upper Stehekin Valley Road away from 
        the Stehekin River due to the current location of the non-
        wilderness road corridor provided by Congress in 1988.
            (6) It is a high priority that the people of the United 
        States, including families, the disabled, and the elderly, have 
        reasonable access to the National Parks system and their public 
        lands.
            (7) The 1995 Lake Chelan National Recreation Area General 
        Management Plan calls for retaining vehicle access to 
        Cottonwood Camp.
            (8) Tourism associated with the North Cascades National 
        Park Complex is an important part of the economy for rural 
        communities in the area.
            (9) Additional management flexibility would allow the 
        National Park Service to consider retention of the upper 
        Stehekin Valley Road in a manner that provides for no net loss 
        of wilderness.

SEC. 602. AUTHORIZATION FOR BOUNDARY ADJUSTMENTS.

    The Washington Park Wilderness Act of 1988 (Public Law 100-668) is 
amended by inserting after section 206 the following:

``SEC. 207. BOUNDARY ADJUSTMENTS FOR ROAD.

    ``(a) In General.--The Secretary may adjust the boundaries of the 
North Cascades National Park and the Stephen Mather Wilderness in order 
to provide a corridor of not more than 100 feet in width along which 
the Stehekin Valley Road may be rebuilt--
            ``(1) outside of the floodplain between milepost 12.9 and 
        milepost 22.8;
            ``(2) within one mile of the route, on the date of the 
        enactment of this section, of the Stehekin Valley Road;
            ``(3) within the boundaries of the North Cascades National 
        Park; and
            ``(4) outside of the boundaries of the Stephen Mather 
        Wilderness.
    ``(b) No Net Loss of Lands.--
            ``(1) In general.--The boundary adjustments made under this 
        section shall be such that equal amounts of federally owned 
        acreage are exchanged between the Stephen Mather Wilderness and 
        the North Cascades National Park, resulting in no net loss of 
        acreage to either the Stephen Mather Wilderness or the North 
        Cascades National Park.
            ``(2) Stehekin valley road lands.--The newly designated 
        wilderness shall include the lands along the route of the 
        Stehekin Valley Road that are replaced by the reconstruction.
            ``(3) Equalization of land.--If the lands described in 
        paragraph (2) contain fewer acres than the corridor described 
        in subsection (a), the Secretary may designate additional 
        Federal lands in the North Cascades National Park as 
        wilderness, but such designation may not exceed the amount 
        needed to equalize the exchange and these additional lands must 
        be selected from lands that qualify as wilderness under section 
        2(c) of the Wilderness Act (16 U.S.C. 1131(c)).
    ``(c) No Sale or Acquisition Authorized.--Nothing in this title 
authorizes the sale or acquisition of any land or interest in land.
    ``(d) No Priority Required.--Nothing in this title shall be 
construed as requiring the Secretary to give this project precedence 
over the construction or repair of other similarly damaged roads in 
units of the National Park System.''.

  TITLE VII--ENDANGERED SALMON AND FISHERIES PREDATION PREVENTION ACT

SEC. 701. SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``Endangered Salmon and Fisheries 
Predation Prevention Act''.

SEC. 702. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) There are 13 groups of salmon and steelhead that are 
        listed as threatened species or endangered species under the 
        Endangered Species Act of 1973 that migrate through the lower 
        Columbia River.
            (2) The people of the Northwest United States are united in 
        their desire to restore healthy salmon and steelhead runs, as 
        they are integral to the region's culture and economy.
            (3) The Columbia River treaty tribes retain important 
        rights with respect to salmon and steelhead.
            (4) Federal, State, and tribal governments have spent 
        billions of dollars to assist the recovery of Columbia River 
        salmon and steelhead populations.
            (5) One of the factors impacting salmonid populations is 
        increased predation by marine mammals, including California sea 
        lions.
            (6) The population of California sea lions has increased 6-
        fold over the last 3 decades, and is currently greater than 
        250,000 animals.
            (7) In recent years, more than 1,000 California sea lions 
        have been foraging in the lower 145 miles of the Columbia River 
        up to Bonneville Dam during the peak spring salmonid run before 
        returning to the California coast to mate.
            (8) The percentage of the spring salmonid run that has been 
        eaten or killed by California sea lions at Bonneville Dam has 
        increased 7-fold since 2002.
            (9) In recent years, California sea lions have with greater 
        frequency congregated near Bonneville Dam and have entered the 
        fish ladders.
            (10) These California sea lions have not been responsive to 
        extensive hazing methods employed near Bonneville Dam to 
        discourage this behavior.
            (11) The process established under the 1994 amendment to 
        the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 to address aggressive 
        sea lion behavior is protracted and will not work in a timely 
        enough manner to protect threatened and endangered salmonids in 
        the near term.
            (12) In the interest of protecting Columbia River 
        threatened and endangered salmonids, a temporary expedited 
        procedure is urgently needed to allow removal of the minimum 
        number of California sea lions as is necessary to protect the 
        passage of threatened and endangered salmonids in the Columbia 
        River and its tributaries.
            (13) On December 21, 2010, the independent Pinniped-Fishery 
        Interaction Task Force recommended lethally removing more of 
        the California sea lions in 2011.
            (14) On August 18, 2011, the States of Washington, Oregon, 
        and Idaho applied to the National Marine Fisheries Service, 
        under section 120(b)(1)(A) of the Marine Mammal Protection Act 
        of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1389(b)(1)(A)), for the lethal removal of 
        sea lions that the States determined are having a ``significant 
        negative impact'' on the recovery of Columbia River and Snake 
        River salmon and steelhead.
            (15) On September 12, 2011, the National Marine Fisheries 
        Service announced it was accepting the States' application for 
        lethal removal of sea lions and that it would reconvene the 
        Pinniped-Fishery Interaction Task Force to consider the States' 
        application. This title will ensure the necessary authority for 
        permits under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 to be 
        issued in a timely fashion.
            (16) During a June 14, 2011, hearing, the Committee on 
        Natural Resources of the House of Representatives received 
        testimony from State and tribal witnesses expressing concern 
        that significant pinniped predation of important Northwest fish 
        resources other than salmonids is severely impacting fish 
        stocks determined by both Federal and State fishery management 
        agencies to be at low levels of abundance, and that this cannot 
        be addressed by section 120 of the Marine Mammal Protection Act 
        of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1389), which as in effect before the 
        enactment of this Act restricted control of predatory 
        pinnipeds' impact only with respect to endangered salmonids.

    Section 120 of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 
1389) is amended by striking subsection (f) and inserting the 
following:

        lions that are part of a healthy population that is not listed 
        as an endangered species or threatened species under the 
        Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.), to

            ``(6) Suspension of permitting authority.--If, 5 years 
        after enactment, the Secretary, after consulting with State and 
        tribal fishery managers, determines that lethal removal

        and nonlethal removal measures for preventing such predation.

SEC. 705. TREATY RIGHTS OF FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED INDIAN TRIBES.

SEC. 901. SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``Yerington Land Conveyance and 
Sustainable Development Act''.

SEC. 902. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) the city of Yerington, Nevada, which has an 
        unemployment rate of 16 percent, has the highest unemployment 
        rate in the State of Nevada;
            (2) for over 4 years, the city of Yerington and Lyon 
        County, Nevada, have been working with private business 
        partners to develop a sustainable development plan that would 
        enable all parties to benefit from the use of private land 
        adjacent to the city of Yerington for potential commercial and 
        industrial development, mining activities, recreation 
        opportunities, and the expansion of community and cultural 
        events;
            (3) the sustainable development plan referred to in 
        paragraph (2) requires the conveyance of certain Federal land 
        administered by the Bureau of Land Management to the City for 
        consideration in an amount equal to the fair market value of 
        the Federal land;
            (4) the Federal land to be conveyed to the City under the 
        sustainable development plan has very few environmental, 
        historical, wildlife, or cultural resources of value to the 
        public, but is appropriate for responsible development;
            (5) the Federal land that would be conveyed to the City 
        under the sustainable development plan--
                    (A) is adjacent to the boundaries of the City; and
                    (B) would be used--
                            (i) to enhance recreational, cultural, 
                        commercial, and industrial development 
                        opportunities in the City;
                            (ii) for future economic development, 
                        regional use, and as an open space buffer to 
                        the City; and
                            (iii) to allow the City to provide critical 
                        infrastructure services;
            (6) commercial and industrial development of the Federal 
        land would enable the community to benefit from the 
        transportation, power, and water infrastructure that would be 
        put in place with the concurrent development of commercial and 
        industrial operations;
            (7) the conveyance of the Federal land would--
                    (A) help the City and County to grow; and
                    (B) provide additional tax revenue to the City and 
                County;
            (8) industrial and commercial development of the Federal 
        land would create thousands of long-term, high-paying jobs for 
        the City and County; and
            (9) the Lyon County Commission and the City unanimously 
        approved resolutions in support of the conveyance of the 
        Federal land because the conveyance would facilitate a 
        sustainable model for long-term economic and industrial 
        development.

    TITLE XII--TARGET PRACTICE AND MARKSMANSHIP TRAINING SUPPORT ACT

SEC. 1201. SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``Target Practice and Marksmanship 
Training Support Act''.

SEC. 1202. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) the use of firearms and archery equipment for target 
        practice and marksmanship training activities on Federal land 
        is allowed, except to the extent specific portions of that land 
        have been closed to those activities;
            (2) in recent years preceding the date of enactment of this 
        title, portions of Federal land have been closed to target 
        practice and marksmanship training for many reasons;
            (3) the availability of public target ranges on non-Federal 
        land has been declining for a variety of reasons, including 
        continued population growth and development near former ranges;
            (4) providing opportunities for target practice and 
        marksmanship training at public target ranges on Federal and 
        non-Federal land can help--
                    (A) to promote enjoyment of shooting, recreational, 
                and hunting activities; and
                    (B) to ensure safe and convenient locations for 
                those activities;
            (5) Federal law in effect on the date of enactment of this 
        title, including the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act 
        (16 U.S.C. 669 et seq.), provides Federal support for 
        construction and expansion of public target ranges by making 
        available to States amounts that may be used for construction, 
        operation, and maintenance of public target ranges; and
            (6) it is in the public interest to provide increased 
        Federal support to facilitate the construction or expansion of 
        public target ranges.
    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this title is to facilitate the 
construction and expansion of public target ranges, including ranges on 
Federal land managed by the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land 
Management.
