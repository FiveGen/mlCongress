                President submits a budget under section 1105 of title 
                31, United States Code, OMB shall calculate and the 
                budget shall include adjustments to discretionary 
                spending limits (and those limits as cumulatively

                to the baseline levels of new budget authority using 
                up-to-date concepts and definitions minus those levels 
                using the concepts and definitions in effect before 
                such changes. Such changes may only be made after

                    (B) Adjustments for congressional enforcement.--For

                adjustments made pursuant to subparagraph (A) as 
                contained in the President's budget. Any adjustment 
                made pursuant to this subparagraph shall not constitute

                section.

                        the Committee on the Budget of that House may 
                        adjust the discretionary spending limits in 
                        this section, the budgetary aggregates in the 
                        concurrent resolution on the budget most 
                        recently adopted by the Senate and the House of 
                        Representatives, and allocations pursuant to

                        (i), the Committee on Appropriations of that 
                        House may report appropriately revised 
                        suballocations pursuant to section 302(b) of

                        out this subsection.
                    (B) Other adjustments.--For the purposes of 
                determining an end of the year sequester pursuant to

                        consultation with the Committees on the Budget 
                        of the House of Representatives and the Senate, 
                        shall provide OMB with an estimate of the 
                        amount of discretionary new budget authority 
                        for the current year (if any) and the budget 
                        year provided by that legislation.
                            (ii) OMB estimates and explanation of 
                        differences.--

                                date of enactment of any discretionary 
                                appropriation, OMB shall make publicly 
                                available on the day it is issued and, 
                                on the following day, shall be printed 
                                in the Federal Register a report 
                                containing the CBO estimate of that 
                                legislation, an OMB estimate of the 
                                amount of discretionary new budget 
                                authority for the current year (if any) 
                                and the budget year provided by that

                                determines that there is a significant 
                                difference between OMB and CBO, OMB 
                                shall consult with the Committees on 
                                the Budget of the House of

                                communication to those committees that 
                                affords such committees the opportunity 
                                to comment before the issuance of the 
                                report.
                    (D) Assumptions and guidelines.--OMB estimates 
                under subparagraph (C) shall be made using current 
                economic and technical assumptions. In its final 
                sequestration report, OMB shall use the OMB estimates 
                transmitted to the Congress under this paragraph. OMB 
                and CBO shall prepare estimates under this paragraph in 
                conformance with scorekeeping guidelines determined 
                after consultation among the House and Senate

                enacted legislation.
            (2) Other adjustments.--Other adjustments referred to in 
        paragraph (1)(B) are as follows:
                    (A) Continuing disability reviews and ssi 
                redeterminations.--
                            (i) In general.--If a bill or joint 
                        resolution is reported making appropriations in 
                        a fiscal year of the amount specified in clause 
                        (ii) for continuing disability reviews and 
                        Supplemental Security Income redeterminations 
                        under the heading ``Limitation on 
                        Administrative Expenses'' for the Social 
                        Security Administration, and provides an

                        disability reviews and Supplemental Security 
                        Income redeterminations for the Social Security 
                        Administration, or one or more initiatives that 
                        the Office of the Chief Actuary determines 
                        would be at least as cost effective as a 
                        redetermination of eligibility under the 
                        heading ``Limitation on Administrative 
                        Expenses'' for the Social Security 
                        Administration of an amount further specified 
                        in clause (ii), then the discretionary spending 
                        limits, allocation to the Committees on 
                        Appropriations of each House, and aggregates 
                        for that year may be adjusted by the amount in 
                        budget authority not to exceed the additional 
                        appropriation provided in such legislation for 
                        that purpose for that fiscal year.

                with overseas deployments and related activities if the 
                amount of budget authority above those levels is

                set in subsection (c)(3)(B)(i), or for fiscal years 
                2013-2021 that would cause the total adjustment for 
                fiscal years 2013-2021 to exceed the amount authorized

                        in all fiscal years from such appropriations 
                        shall not be counted in determining whether a 
                        breach has occurred, and shall not count for 
                        the purposes of Congressional enforcement.
                            (ii) Designation in the house of 
                        representatives.--If an appropriations act

                                against an emergency designation in 
                                that measure, that provision making 
                                such a designation shall be stricken 
                                from the measure and may not be offered 
                                as an amendment from the floor.

                                        affirmative vote of three-
                                        fifths of the Members, duly 
                                        chosen and sworn.

                                        the Senate from the decisions

                                        shall be limited to 1 hour, to 
                                        be equally divided between, and 
                                        controlled by, the appellant 
                                        and the manager of the bill or

                                        may be. An affirmative vote of 
                                        three-fifths of the Members of 
                                        the Senate, duly chosen and

                                        of the Chair on a point of 
                                        order raised under this 
                                        subsection.
                                    (III) Definition of an emergency 
                                designation.--For purposes of subclause 
                                (I), a provision shall be considered an 
                                emergency designation if it designates 
                                any item as an emergency requirement 
                                pursuant to this subsection.
                                    (IV) Form of the point of order.--A 
                                point of order under subclause (I) may 
                                be raised by a Senator as provided in 
                                section 313(e) of the Congressional 
                                Budget Act of 1974.
                                    (V) Conference reports.--When the 
                                Senate is considering a conference 
                                report on, or an amendment between the 
                                Houses in relation to, an 
                                appropriations act, upon a point of 
                                order being made by any Senator 
                                pursuant to this section, and such 
                                point of order being sustained, such 
                                material contained in such conference 
                                report shall be deemed stricken, and 
                                the Senate shall proceed to consider 
                                the question of whether the Senate 
                                shall recede from its amendment and 
                                concur with a further amendment, or 
                                concur in the House amendment with a 
                                further amendment, as the case may be, 
                                which further amendment shall consist 
                                of only that portion of the conference 
                                report or House amendment, as the case 
                                may be, not so stricken. Any such 
                                motion in the Senate shall be debatable 
                                under the same conditions as was the 
                                conference report. In any case in which 
                                such point of order is sustained 
                                against a conference report (or Senate 
                                amendment derived from such conference 
                                report by operation of this 
                                subsection), no further amendment shall 
                                be in order.
            (2) Eliminating a breach.--Each non-exempt account within a 
        category shall be reduced by a dollar amount calculated by 
        multiplying the baseline level of sequesterable budgetary 
        resources in that account at that time by the uniform 
        percentage necessary to eliminate a breach within that 
        category.
            (3) Military personnel.--
                    (A) In general.--The President may, with respect to 
                any military personnel account, exempt that account 
                from sequestration or provide for a lower uniform 
                percentage reduction than would otherwise apply, 
                provided that the President has notified Congress of 
                the manner in which such authority will be exercised 
                pursuant to paragraph (7)(A)(ii).
                    (B) Reductions.--If the President uses the 
                authority to exempt any military personnel from 
                sequestration under paragraph (7)(A)(ii), each account 
                within subfunctional category 051 (other than those 
                military personnel accounts for which the authority 
                provided under clause (i) has been exercised) shall be 
                further reduced by a dollar amount calculated by 
                multiplying the enacted level of non-exempt budgetary 
                resources in that account at that time by the uniform 
                percentage necessary to offset the total dollar amount 
                by which budget authority is not reduced in military 
                personnel accounts by reason of the use of such 
                authority.
            (4) Part-year appropriations.--If, on the date specified in 
        paragraph (1), there is in effect an Act making or continuing 
        appropriations for part of a fiscal year for any budget 
        account, then the dollar sequestration calculated for that 
        account under paragraphs (2) and (3) shall be subtracted from--
                    (A) the annualized amount otherwise available by 
                law in that account under that or a subsequent part-
                year appropriation; and
                    (B) when a full-year appropriation for that account 
                is enacted, from the amount otherwise provided by the 
                full-year appropriation.
            (5) Look-back.--If, after June 30, an appropriation for the 
        fiscal year in progress is enacted that causes a breach within 
        a category for that year (after taking into account any 
        sequestration of amounts within that category), the 
        discretionary spending limits for that category for the next 
        fiscal year shall be reduced by the amount or amounts of that 
        breach.
            (6) Within-session sequestration.--If an appropriation for 
        a fiscal year in progress is enacted (after Congress adjourns 
        to end the session for that budget year and before July 1 of 
        that fiscal year) that causes a breach within a category for 
        that year (after taking into account any prior sequestration of 
        amounts within that category), 15 days after such enactment 
        there shall be a sequestration to eliminate that breach within 
        that category following the procedures set forth in paragraphs 
        (2) through (4).
            (7) Reports.--
                    (A) Sequestration preview report.--
                            (i) In general.--Not later than 5 days

                        through those dates. The preview report shall 
                        set forth estimates for the current year and 
                        each subsequent year through 2021 of the 
                        applicable discretionary spending limits for 
                        each category and an explanation of any 
                        adjustments in such limits under this section.
                            (ii) Notification regarding military 
                        personnel.--On or before the date of the 
                        sequestration preview report, the President 
                        shall notify the Congress of the manner in 
                        which he intends to exercise flexibility with 
                        respect to military personnel accounts under 
                        subsection (f)(3).
                            (iii) Explanation of differences.--The OMB 
                        reports shall explain the differences between 
                        OMB and CBO estimates for each item set forth 
                        in this subsection.
                    (B) Sequestration update report.--Not later than 
                August 15 for CBO, and August 20 for OMB, OMB and CBO 
                shall issue a sequestration update report, reflecting 
                laws enacted through those dates, containing all of the 
                information required in the sequestration preview 
                reports. This report shall also contain a preview 
                estimate of the adjustment for disaster funding for the 
                upcoming fiscal year.
                    (C) Final sequestration report.--Not later than 10 
                days after the end of session for CBO, and 14 days 
                after the end of session for OMB (excluding weekends 
                and holidays), OMB and CBO shall issue a final 
                sequestration report, updated to reflect laws enacted 
                through those dates, with estimates for each of the 
                following:
                            (i) For the current year and each 
                        subsequent year through 2021 the applicable 
                        discretionary spending limits for each category 
                        and an explanation of any adjustments in such 
                        limits under this section, including a final

    (a) Eligible Federal Entities.--Section 113(g)(1) of the National 
Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization Act (47 
U.S.C. 923(g)(1)) is amended to read as follows:
            ``(1) Eligible federal entities.--Any Federal entity that 
        operates a Federal Government station authorized to use a band 
        of frequencies specified in paragraph (2) and that incurs 
        relocation costs because of planning for a potential auction of 
        spectrum frequencies, a planned auction of spectrum 
        frequencies, or the reallocation of spectrum frequencies from 
        Federal use to exclusive non-Federal use, or shared Federal and 
        non-Federal use shall receive payment for such costs from the 
        Spectrum Relocation Fund, in accordance with section 118 of 
        this Act. For purposes of this paragraph, Federal power 
        agencies exempted under subsection (c)(4) that choose to

        purposes of this subsection, the terms `relocation costs' and 
        `sharing costs' mean the costs incurred by a Federal entity to 
        plan for a potential or planned auction or sharing of spectrum 
        frequencies and to achieve comparable capability of systems, 
        regardless of whether that capability is achieved by relocating 
        to a new frequency assignment, relocating a Federal Government 
        station to a different geographic location, modifying Federal 
        Government equipment to mitigate interference or use less 
        spectrum, in terms of bandwidth, geography, or time, and 
        thereby permitting spectrum sharing (including sharing among 
        relocated Federal entities and incumbents to make spectrum 
        available for non-Federal use) or relocation, or by utilizing 
        an alternative technology. Comparable capability of systems 
        includes the acquisition of state-of-the art replacement 
        systems intended to meet comparable operational scope, which 
        may include incidental increases in functionality. Such costs 
        include--

                activities of an eligible Federal entity, and 
                reasonable additional costs incurred by the Federal 
                entity that are attributable to relocation or sharing, 
                including increased recurring costs above recurring 
                costs of the system before relocation for the remaining

                primary allocation or protected status, when the 
                eligible frequencies as defined in paragraph (2) of 
                this subsection are made available for private sector 
                uses by competitive bidding and a Federal entity 
                retains primary allocation or protected status in those 
                frequencies for a period of time after the completion 
                of the competitive bidding process;
                    ``(E) the costs associated with the accelerated 
                replacement of systems and equipment if such 
                acceleration is necessary to ensure the timely 
                relocation of systems to a new frequency assignment or 
                the timely accommodation of sharing of Federal 
                frequencies; and

        costs as a result of such access is eligible for payment from 
        the Fund for the purposes specified in paragraph (3) of this 
        section. The revenue associated with such access shall be at 
        least 110 percent of the estimated Federal costs.''.

        authorized to consider a joint committee bill reports it to the 
        House or has been discharged (other than by motion) from its 
        consideration, it shall be in order to move to proceed to 
        consider the joint committee bill in the House. Such a motion

        to proceed with respect to the joint committee bill. The

        not be in order.
            (3) Consideration.--The joint committee bill shall be 
        considered as read. All points of order against the joint 
        committee bill and against its consideration are waived. The

        committee bill to its passage without intervening motion except 
        2 hours of debate equally divided and controlled by the 
        proponent and an opponent and one motion to limit debate on the 
        joint committee bill. A motion to reconsider the vote on 
        passage of the joint committee bill shall not be in order.
            (4) Vote on passage.--The vote on passage of the joint 
        committee bill shall occur not later than December 23, 2011.
    (c) Expedited Procedure in the Senate.--
            (1) Committee consideration.--A joint committee bill 
        introduced in the Senate under subsection (a) shall be jointly 
        referred to the committee or committees of jurisdiction, which 
        committees shall report the bill without any revision and with 
        a favorable recommendation, an unfavorable recommendation, or 
        without recommendation, not later than December 9, 2011. If any 
        committee fails to report the bill within that period, that 
        committee shall be automatically discharged from consideration 
        of the bill, and the bill shall be placed on the appropriate 
        calendar.
            (2) Motion to proceed.--Notwithstanding Rule XXII of the 
        Standing Rules of the Senate, it is in order, not later than 2 
        days of session after the date on which a joint committee bill 
        is reported or discharged from all committees to which it was 
        referred, for the majority leader of the Senate or the majority 
        leader's designee to move to proceed to the consideration of 
        the joint committee bill. It shall also be in order for any 
        Member of the Senate to move to proceed to the consideration of 
        the joint committee bill at any time after the conclusion of 
        such 2-day period. A motion to proceed is in order even though 
        a previous motion to the same effect has been disagreed to. All 
        points of order against the motion to proceed to the joint 
        committee bill are waived. The motion to proceed is not 
        debatable. The motion is not subject to a motion to postpone. A 
        motion to reconsider the vote by which the motion is agreed to 
        or disagreed to shall not be in order. If a motion to proceed 
        to the consideration of the joint committee bill is agreed to, 
        the joint committee bill shall remain the unfinished business 
        until disposed of.
            (3) Consideration.--All points of order against the joint 
        committee bill and against consideration of the joint committee 
        bill are waived. Consideration of the joint committee bill and 
        of all debatable motions and appeals in connection therewith 
        shall not exceed a total of 30 hours which shall be divided 
        equally between the majority and minority leaders or their 
        designees. A motion further to limit debate on the joint 
        committee bill is in order, shall require an affirmative vote 
        of three-fifths of the Members duly chosen and sworn, and is 
        not debatable. Any debatable motion or appeal is debatable for 
        not to exceed 1 hour, to be divided equally between those 
        favoring and those opposing the motion or appeal. All time used 
        for consideration of the joint committee bill, including time 
        used for quorum calls and voting, shall be counted against the 
        total 30 hours of consideration.
            (4) No amendments.--An amendment to the joint committee 
        bill, or a motion to postpone, or a motion to proceed to the 
        consideration of other business, or a motion to recommit the 
        joint committee bill, is not in order.
            (5) Vote on passage.--If the Senate has voted to proceed to 
        the joint committee bill, the vote on passage of the joint 
        committee bill shall occur immediately following the conclusion 
        of the debate on a joint committee bill, and a single quorum 
        call at the conclusion of the debate if requested. The vote on 
        passage of the joint committee bill shall occur not later than 
        December 23, 2011.
            (6) Rulings of the chair on procedure.--Appeals from the 
        decisions of the Chair relating to the application of the rules 
        of the Senate, as the case may be, to the procedure relating to 
        a joint committee bill shall be decided without debate.
    (d) Amendment.--The joint committee bill shall not be subject to 
amendment in either the House of Representatives or the Senate.
    (e) Consideration by the Other House.--
            (1) In general.--If, before passing the joint committee 
        bill, one House receives from the other a joint committee 
        bill--
                    (A) the joint committee bill of the other House 
                shall not be referred to a committee; and
                    (B) the procedure in the receiving House shall be 
                the same as if no joint committee bill had been 
                received from the other House until the vote on 
                passage, when the joint committee bill received from 
                the other House shall supplant the joint committee bill 
                of the receiving House.
            (2) Revenue measure.--This subsection shall not apply to 
        the House of Representatives if the joint committee bill 
        received from the Senate is a revenue measure.
    (f) Rules To Coordinate Action With Other House.--
            (1) Treatment of joint committee bill of other house.--If 
        the Senate fails to introduce or consider a joint committee 
        bill under this section, the joint committee bill of the House 
        shall be entitled to expedited floor procedures under this 
        section.
            (2) Treatment of companion measures in the senate.--If 
        following passage of the joint committee bill in the Senate, 
        the Senate then receives the joint committee bill from the 
        House of Representatives, the House-passed joint committee bill 
        shall not be debatable. The vote on passage of the joint 
        committee bill in the Senate shall be considered to be the vote 
        on passage of the joint committee bill received from the House 
        of Representatives.
            (3) Vetoes.--If the President vetoes the joint committee 
        bill, debate on a veto message in the Senate under this section 
        shall be 1 hour equally divided between the majority and 
        minority leaders or their designees.
    (g) Loss of Privilege.--The provisions of this section shall cease 
to apply to the joint committee bill if--
            (1) the joint committee fails to vote on the report or 
        proposed legislative language required under section 
        201(b)(3)(B)(i) by November 23, 2011; or
            (2) the joint committee bill does not pass both Houses by 
        December 23, 2011.

SEC. 303. FUNDING.

    Funding for the joint committee shall be derived from the 
applicable account of the House of Representatives, and the contingent 
fund of the Senate from the appropriations account ``Miscellaneous 
Items,'' subject to Senate rules and regulations.

SEC. 304. RULEMAKING.

    The provisions of this title are enacted by Congress--
            (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the House of 
        Representatives and the Senate, respectively, and as such they 
        shall be considered as part of the rules of each House, 
        respectively, or of that House to which they specifically 
        apply, and such rules shall supersede other rules only to the 
        extent that they are inconsistent therewith; and
            (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of 
        either House to change such rules (so far as relating to such 
        House) at any time, in the same manner, and to the same extent 
        as in the case of any other rule of such House.
