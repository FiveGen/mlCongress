    (a) In General.--Section 1303 of the Patient Protection and

        subsection (c) inserted by paragraph (4) of this subsection 
        with appropriate indentation (and conforming the style of the 
        heading to a subsection heading);
            (3) by amending subsection (b) to read as follows:
    ``(b) Special Rules Relating to Training in and Coverage of 
Abortion Services.--Nothing in this Act (or any amendment made by this 
Act) shall be construed to require any health plan to provide coverage 
of or access to abortion services or to allow the Secretary or any 
other Federal or non-Federal person or entity in implementing this Act 
(or amendment) to require coverage of, access to, or training in 
abortion services.'';
            (4) by inserting after subsection (b) the following new 
        subsection:
    ``(c) Limitation on Abortion Funding.--
            ``(1) In general.--No funds authorized or appropriated by 
        this Act (or an amendment made by this Act), including credits 
        applied toward qualified health plans under section 36B of the 
        Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or cost-sharing reductions under 
        section 1402 of this Act, may be used to pay for any abortion 
        or to cover any part of the costs of any health plan that 
        includes coverage of abortion, except--
                    ``(A) if the pregnancy is the result of an act of 
                rape or incest; or
                    ``(B) in the case where a pregnant female suffers 
                from a physical disorder, physical injury, or physical 
                illness that would, as certified by a physician, place 
                the female in danger of death unless an abortion is 
                performed, including a life-endangering physical 
                condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy 
                itself.
            ``(2) Option to purchase separate coverage or plan.--
        Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as prohibiting 
        any non-Federal entity (including an individual or a State or 
        local government) from purchasing separate coverage for 
        abortions for which funding is prohibited under this 
        subsection, or a qualified health plan that includes such 
        abortions, so long as--
                    ``(A) such coverage or plan is paid for entirely 
                using only funds not authorized or appropriated by this 
                Act; and
                    ``(B) such coverage or plan is not purchased 
                using--
                            ``(i) individual premium payments required 
                        for a qualified health plan offered through an 
                        Exchange towards which a credit is applied 
                        under section 36B of the Internal Revenue Code 
                        of 1986; or
                            ``(ii) other non-Federal funds required to 
                        receive a Federal payment, including a State's 
                        or locality's contribution of Medicaid matching 
                        funds.
            ``(3) Option to offer coverage or plan.--Nothing in this 
        subsection or section 1311(d)(2)(B)(i) shall restrict any non-
        Federal health insurance issuer offering a qualified health 
        plan from offering separate coverage for abortions for which 
        funding is prohibited under this subsection, or a qualified 
        health plan that includes such abortions, so long as--
                    ``(A) premiums for such separate coverage or plan 
                are paid for entirely with funds not authorized or 
                appropriated by this Act;

                that includes coverage for abortions for which funding 
                is prohibited under this subsection also offers a 
                qualified health plan through the Exchange that is 
                identical in every respect except that it does not 
                cover abortions for which funding is prohibited under 
                this subsection.'';
            (5) in subsection (e), as redesignated by paragraph (1)--
                    (A) in the heading, by striking ``Regarding 
                Abortion'';
                    (B) in the heading of each of paragraphs (1) and 
                (2), by striking each place it appears ``regarding 
                abortion'';
                    (C) in paragraph (1), by striking ``regarding the 
                prohibition of (or requirement of) coverage, funding, 
                or'' and inserting ``protecting conscience rights, 
                restricting or prohibiting abortion or coverage or

        assistance under this Act (or an amendment made by this Act),

        entity to discrimination, or require any health plan created or 
        regulated under this Act (or an amendment made by this Act) to 
        subject any institutional or individual health care entity to 
        discrimination, on the basis that the health care entity 
        refuses to--
                    ``(A) undergo training in the performance of 
                induced abortions;
