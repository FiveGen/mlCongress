        en route to the NBA Championship;
Whereas the Mavericks epitomized a ``never say die'' attitude during the 2011 
        NBA Finals, overcoming losses in games 1 and 3 of the NBA Finals with 
        thrilling fourth quarter comebacks in games 2, 4, and 5 to take a 3-2 
        series lead;
Whereas, on June 12, 2011, the Mavericks won the 2011 NBA Championship in 6 
        games over the Miami Heat;

Whereas third-year Head Coach Rick Carlisle and his assistants helped transform 
        the Mavericks from a perennial playoff contender into the NBA's best;
Whereas Dirk Nowitzki, who has spent his entire 13-year career with the

        Valuable Player Award;
Whereas longtime Mavericks guard Jason Terry scored a game high 27 points in 
        game 6 to carry the Mavericks to the championship;
Whereas 17-year NBA veteran Jason Kidd set the tone for the Mavericks' success 
        through his patient, calm, and disciplined leadership;
Whereas Shawn Marion, Tyson Chandler, DeShawn Stevenson, and Jose Juan ``J.J.'' 
        Barea provided balance on offense and defense to help pave the way to 
        the championship;
