shall award reasonable attorney's fees and costs to a substantially 
prevailing small business in any civil action arising under this title.

action is filed. Such award shall be paid out of the administrative 
budget of the office in the agency that took the challenged agency 
action.

and Settlements Act of 2012''.

    (a) Application.--The provisions of this section apply in the case 
of--
            (1) a consent decree or settlement agreement in an action 
        to compel agency action alleged to be unlawfully withheld or 
        unreasonably delayed that pertains to a regulatory action that 
        affects the rights of private parties other than the plaintiff 
        or the rights of State, local or Tribal government entities--
                    (A) brought under chapter 7 of title 5, United 
                States Code; or
                    (B) brought under any other statute authorizing 
                such an action; and
            (2) any other consent decree or settlement agreement that

        that affects the rights of private parties other than the 
        plaintiff or the rights of State, local or Tribal government 
        entities.
    (b) In General.--In the case of an action to be resolved by a

        decree or settlement agreement and its terms, and any award of 
        attorneys' fees or costs shall be published, including 
        electronically, in a readily accessible manner by the defendant 
        agency.
            (2) Until the conclusion of an opportunity for affected 
        parties to intervene in the action, a party may not file with 
        the court a motion for a consent decree or to dismiss the case 
        pursuant to a settlement agreement.
            (3) In considering a motion to intervene by any party that 
        would be affected by the agency action in dispute, the court 
        shall presume, subject to rebuttal, that the interests of that 
        party would not be represented adequately by the current 
        parties to the action. In considering a motion to intervene 
        filed by a State, local or Tribal government entity, the court 
        shall take due account of whether the movant--
                    (A) administers jointly with the defendant agency 
                the statutory provisions that give rise to the 
                regulatory duty alleged in the complaint; or
                    (B) administers State, local or Tribal regulatory 
                authority that would be preempted by the defendant 
                agency's discharge of the regulatory duty alleged in 
                the complaint.
            (4) If the court grants a motion to intervene in the 
        action, the court shall include the plaintiff, the defendant 
        agency, and the intervenors in settlement discussions. 
        Settlement efforts conducted shall be pursuant to a court's 
        mediation or alternative dispute resolution program, or by a 
        district judge, magistrate judge, or special master, as 
        determined by the assigned judge.
            (5) The defendant agency shall publish in the Federal 
        Register and by electronic means any proposed consent decree or 
        settlement agreement for no fewer than 60 days of public 
        comment before filing it with the court, including a statement 
        of the statutory basis for the proposed consent decree or 
        settlement agreement and its terms, allowing comment on any 
        issue related to the matters alleged in the complaint or 
        addressed or affected by the consent decree or settlement 
        agreement.
            (6) The defendant agency shall--
                    (A) respond to public comments received under 
                paragraph (5); and
                    (B) when moving that the court enter the consent 
                decree or for dismissal pursuant to the settlement 
                agreement--
                            (i) inform the court of the statutory basis 
                        for the proposed consent decree or settlement 
                        agreement and its terms;
                            (ii) submit to the court a summary of the 
                        public comments and agency responses;
                            (iii) certify the index to the 
                        administrative record of the notice and comment 
                        proceeding to the court; and
                            (iv) make that record fully accessible to 
                        the court.
            (7) The court shall include in the judicial record the full 
        administrative record, the index to which was certified by the 
        agency under paragraph (6).
            (8) If the consent decree or settlement agreement requires

        the settlement agreement--
                    (A) inform the court of any uncompleted mandatory 
                duties to take regulatory action that the decree or 
                agreement does not address;
                    (B) how the decree or agreement, if approved, would 
                affect the discharge of those duties; and
                    (C) why the decree's or agreement's effects on the 
                order in which the agency discharges its mandatory 
                duties is in the public interest.
            (9) The court shall presume, subject to rebuttal, that it 
        is proper to allow amicus participation by any party who filed 
        public comments on the consent decree or settlement agreement 
        during the court's consideration of a motion to enter the 
        decree or dismiss the case on the basis of the agreement.
            (10) The court shall ensure that the proposed consent 
        decree or settlement agreement allows sufficient time and 
        procedure for the agency to comply with chapter 5 of title 5, 
        United States Code, and other applicable statutes that govern 
        rule making and, unless contrary to the public interest, the 
        provisions of any executive orders that govern rule making.
            (11) The defendant agency may, at its discretion, hold a 
        public hearing pursuant to notice in the Federal Register and 
        by electronic means, on whether to enter into the consent 
        decree or settlement agreement. If such a hearing is held, 
        then, in accordance with paragraph (6), the agency shall submit 
        to the court a summary of the proceedings and the certified 
        index to the hearing record, full access to the hearing record 
        shall be given to the court, and the full hearing record shall 
        be included in the judicial record.
            (12) The Attorney General, in cases litigated by the 
        Department of Justice, or the head of the defendant Federal 
        agency, in cases litigated independently by that agency, shall 
        certify to the court his or her approval of any proposed 
        consent decree or settlement agreement that contains any of the 
        following terms--
                    (A) in the case of a consent decree, terms that--
                            (i) convert into mandatory duties the 
                        otherwise discretionary authorities of an 
                        agency to propose, promulgate, revise or amend 
                        regulations;
                            (ii) commit the agency to expend funds that 
                        Congress has not appropriated and that have not 
                        been budgeted for the action in question, or 
                        commit an agency to seek a particular 
                        appropriation or budget authorization;
                            (iii) divest the agency of discretion 
                        committed to it by Congress or the 
                        Constitution, whether such discretionary power 
                        was granted to respond to changing 
                        circumstances, to make policy or managerial 
                        choices, or to protect the rights of third 
                        parties; or
                            (iv) otherwise afford relief that the court 
                        could not enter on its own authority upon a 
                        final judgment in the litigation; or
                    (B) in the case of a settlement agreement, terms 
                that--
                            (i) interfere with the agency's authority 
                        to revise, amend, or issue rules through the 
                        procedures set forth in chapter 5 of title 5, 
                        United States Code, or any other statute or 
                        executive order prescribing rule making 
                        procedures for rule makings that are the 
                        subject of the settlement agreement;
                            (ii) commit the agency to expend funds that 
                        Congress has not appropriated and that have not 
                        been budgeted for the action in question; or
                            (iii) provide a remedy for the agency's 
                        failure to comply with the terms of the 
                        settlement agreement other than the revival of 
                        the action resolved by the settlement 
                        agreement, if the agreement commits the agency 
                        to exercise its discretion in a particular way 
                        and such discretionary power was committed to 
                        the agency by Congress or the Constitution to 
                        respond to changing circumstances, to make 
                        policy or managerial choices, or to protect the 
                        rights of third parties.
    (c) Annual Reports.--Each agency shall submit an annual report to 
Congress on the number, identity, and content of complaints, consent 
decrees, and settlement agreements described in paragraph (1) for that 
year, the statutory basis for each consent decree or settlement 
agreement and its terms, and any awards of attorneys fees or costs in 
actions resolved by such decrees or agreements.

SEC. 303. MOTIONS TO MODIFY CONSENT DECREES.

    When a defendant agency moves the court to modify a previously 
entered consent decree described under section 302 and the basis of the 
motion is that the terms of the decree are no longer fully in the 
public interest due to the agency's obligations to fulfill other duties 
or due to changed facts and circumstances, the court shall review the 
motion and the consent decree de novo.

SEC. 304. EFFECTIVE DATE.

    The provisions of this title apply to any covered consent decree or 
settlement agreement proposed to a court after the date of enactment of 
this title.

                only after focused deliberation on their effects; and
            (2) to enhance the ability of Congress and the public to

        assessment comparing the authorized level of funding in a bill 
        or resolution to the prospective costs of carrying out any 
        changes to a condition of Federal assistance being imposed on 
        State, local, or tribal governments participating in the 
        Federal assistance program concerned or, in the case of a bill

SEC. 408. REGULATORY PROCESS AND PRINCIPLES.

    Section 201 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 
1531) is amended to read as follows:

``SEC. 201. REGULATORY PROCESS AND PRINCIPLES.

    ``(a) In General.--Each agency shall, unless otherwise expressly 
prohibited by law, assess the effects of Federal regulatory actions on 
State, local, and tribal governments and the private sector (other than 
to the extent that such regulatory actions incorporate requirements 
specifically set forth in law) in accordance with the following 
principles:
            ``(1) Each agency shall identify the problem that it 
        intends to address (including, if applicable, the failures of 
        private markets or public institutions that warrant new agency 
        action) as well as assess the significance of that problem.
            ``(2) Each agency shall examine whether existing 
        regulations (or other law) have created, or contributed to, the 
        problem that a new regulation is intended to correct and 
        whether those regulations (or other law) should be modified to 
        achieve the intended goal of regulation more effectively.
            ``(3) Each agency shall identify and assess available 
        alternatives to direct regulation, including providing economic 
        incentives to encourage the desired behavior, such as user fees 
        or marketable permits, or providing information upon which 
        choices can be made by the public.
            ``(4) If an agency determines that a regulation is the best 
        available method of achieving the regulatory objective, it 
        shall design its regulations in the most cost-effective manner 
        to achieve the regulatory objective. In doing so, each agency 
        shall consider incentives for innovation, consistency, 
        predictability, the costs of enforcement and compliance (to the 
        government, regulated entities, and the public), flexibility, 
        distributive impacts, and equity.
            ``(5) Each agency shall assess both the costs and the 
        benefits of the intended regulation and, recognizing that some 
        costs and benefits are difficult to quantify, propose or adopt 
        a regulation, unless expressly prohibited by law, only upon a 
        reasoned determination that the benefits of the intended 
        regulation justify its costs.
            ``(6) Each agency shall base its decisions on the best 
        reasonably obtainable scientific, technical, economic, and 
        other information concerning the need for, and consequences of, 
        the intended regulation.
            ``(7) Each agency shall identify and assess alternative 
        forms of regulation and shall, to the extent feasible, specify 
        performance objectives, rather than specifying the behavior or 
        manner of compliance that regulated entities must adopt.
            ``(8) Each agency shall avoid regulations that are 
        inconsistent, incompatible, or duplicative with its other 
        regulations or those of other Federal agencies.
            ``(9) Each agency shall tailor its regulations to minimize 
        the costs of the cumulative impact of regulations.
            ``(10) Each agency shall draft its regulations to be simple 
        and easy to understand, with the goal of minimizing the 
        potential for uncertainty and litigation arising from such 
        uncertainty.
    ``(b) Regulatory Action Defined.--In this section, the term 
`regulatory action' means any substantive action by an agency (normally 
published in the Federal Register) that promulgates or is expected to 
lead to the promulgation of a final rule or regulation, including 
advance notices of proposed rulemaking and notices of proposed 
rulemaking.''.

SEC. 409. EXPANDING THE SCOPE OF STATEMENTS TO ACCOMPANY SIGNIFICANT 
              REGULATORY ACTIONS.

    (a) In General.--Subsection (a) of section 202 of the Unfunded 
Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 1532) is amended to read as 
follows:
    ``(a) In General.--Unless otherwise expressly prohibited by law, 
before promulgating any general notice of proposed rulemaking or any 
final rule, or within six months after promulgating any final rule that 
was not preceded by a general notice of proposed rulemaking, if the 
proposed rulemaking or final rule includes a Federal mandate that may 
result in an annual effect on State, local, or tribal governments, or 
to the private sector, in the aggregate of $50,000,000 or more in any 1 
year, the agency shall prepare a written statement containing the 
following:
            ``(1) The text of the draft proposed rulemaking or final 
        rule, together with a reasonably detailed description of the 
        need for the proposed rulemaking or final rule and an 
        explanation of how the proposed rulemaking or final rule will 
        meet that need.
            ``(2) An assessment of the potential costs and benefits of 
        the proposed rulemaking or final rule, including an explanation 
        of the manner in which the proposed rulemaking or final rule is 
        consistent with a statutory requirement and avoids undue 
        interference with State, local, and tribal governments in the 
        exercise of their governmental functions.
            ``(3) A qualitative and quantitative assessment, including 
        the underlying analysis, of benefits anticipated from the 
        proposed rulemaking or final rule (such as the promotion of the 
        efficient functioning of the economy and private markets, the 
        enhancement of health and safety, the protection of the natural 
        environment, and the elimination or reduction of discrimination 
        or bias).
            ``(4) A qualitative and quantitative assessment, including 
        the underlying analysis, of costs anticipated from the proposed 
        rulemaking or final rule (such as the direct costs both to the 
        Government in administering the final rule and to businesses 
        and others in complying with the final rule, and any adverse 
        effects on the efficient functioning of the economy, private 
        markets (including productivity, employment, and international 
        competitiveness), health, safety, and the natural environment);
            ``(5) Estimates by the agency, if and to the extent that 
        the agency determines that accurate estimates are reasonably 
        feasible, of--
                    ``(A) the future compliance costs of the Federal 
                mandate; and
                    ``(B) any disproportionate budgetary effects of the 
                Federal mandate upon any particular regions of the 
                nation or particular State, local, or tribal 
                governments, urban or rural or other types of 
                communities, or particular segments of the private 
                sector.
            ``(6)(A) A detailed description of the extent of the 
        agency's prior consultation with the private sector and elected 
        representatives (under section 204) of the affected State, 
        local, and tribal governments.
            ``(B) A detailed summary of the comments and concerns that 
        were presented by the private sector and State, local, or 
        tribal governments either orally or in writing to the agency.
            ``(C) A detailed summary of the agency's evaluation of 
        those comments and concerns.
            ``(7) A detailed summary of how the agency complied with

    (b) Requirement for Detailed Summary.--Subsection (b) of section 
202 of such Act is amended by inserting ``detailed'' before 
``summary''.

SEC. 410. ENHANCED STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATION.

    Section 204 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 
1534) is amended--
            (1) in the section heading, by inserting ``and private 
        sector'' before ``input'';
            (2) in subsection (a)--
                    (A) by inserting ``, and impacted parties within 
                the private sector (including small business),'' after 
                ``on their behalf)'';

                mandates'' and inserting ``Federal mandates''; and
            (3) by amending subsection (c) to read as follows:
    ``(c) Guidelines.--For appropriate implementation of subsections 
(a) and (b) consistent with applicable laws and regulations, the 
following guidelines shall be followed:
            ``(1) Consultations shall take place as early as possible, 
        before issuance of a notice of proposed rulemaking, continue 
        through the final rule stage, and be integrated explicitly into 
        the rulemaking process.
            ``(2) Agencies shall consult with a wide variety of State, 
        local, and tribal officials and impacted parties within the 
        private sector (including small businesses). Geographic, 
        political, and other factors that may differentiate varying 
        points of view should be considered.
            ``(3) Agencies should estimate benefits and costs to assist 
        with these consultations. The scope of the consultation should 
        reflect the cost and significance of the Federal mandate being 
        considered.
            ``(4) Agencies shall, to the extent practicable--
                    ``(A) seek out the views of State, local, and 
                tribal governments, and impacted parties within the 
                private sector (including small business), on costs, 
                benefits, and risks; and
                    ``(B) solicit ideas about alternative methods of 
                compliance and potential flexibilities, and input on 
                whether the Federal regulation will harmonize with and 
                not duplicate similar laws in other levels of 
                government.
            ``(5) Consultations shall address the cumulative impact of 
        regulations on the affected entities.
            ``(6) Agencies may accept electronic submissions of 
        comments by relevant parties but may not use those comments as 
        the sole method of satisfying the guidelines in this 
        subsection.''.

SEC. 411. NEW AUTHORITIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES FOR OFFICE OF 
              INFORMATION AND REGULATORY AFFAIRS.

    ``(a) In General.--The Administrator of the Office of Information 
and Regulatory Affairs shall provide meaningful guidance and oversight 
so that each agency's regulations for which a written statement is 
required under section 202 are consistent with the principles and 
requirements of this title, as well as other applicable laws, and do 
not conflict with the policies or actions of another agency. If the 
Administrator determines that an agency's regulations for which a 
written statement is required under section 202 do not comply with such 
principles and requirements, are not consistent with other applicable 
laws, or conflict with the policies or actions of another agency, the 
Administrator shall identify areas of non-compliance, notify the 
agency, and request that the agency comply before the agency finalizes 
the regulation concerned.
    ``(b) Annual Statements to Congress on Agency Compliance.--The 
Director of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs annually 
shall submit to Congress, including the Committee on Homeland Security 
and Governmental Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Oversight

        been adopted, and if not, why they were not adopted.
    ``(c) Preparation of Environmental Documents.--Upon the request of 
the lead agency, the project sponsor shall be authorized to prepare any 
document for purposes of an environmental review required in support of 
any project or approval by the lead agency if the lead agency furnishes 
oversight in such preparation and independently evaluates such document

                may rely on a document other than the environmental 
                document prepared by the lead agency.
                    ``(B) Upon the request of a project sponsor, a lead 
                agency may adopt, use, or rely upon secondary and 
                cumulative impact analyses included in any 
                environmental document prepared under NEPA for projects 
                in the same geographic area where the secondary and 
                cumulative impact analyses provide information and data 
                that pertains to the NEPA decision for the project 
                under review.

        documents.--

                a project under State laws and procedures as the 
                environmental impact statement or environmental 
                assessment for the project, provided that the State 
                laws and procedures under which the document was 
                prepared provide environmental protection and 
                opportunities for public involvement that are 
                substantially equivalent to NEPA.

                subparagraph (A) is deemed to satisfy the lead agency's 
                obligation under NEPA to prepare an environmental 
                impact statement or environmental assessment.

                public on the supplemental document for a period of not 
                more than 45 days beginning on the date of the 
                publication of the supplement.

                decision or finding of no significant impact, as 
                appropriate, based upon the document adopted under 
                subparagraph (A), and any supplements thereto.
            ``(3) Contemporaneous projects.--If the lead agency 
        determines that there is a reasonable likelihood that the 
        project will have similar environmental impacts as a similar 
        project in geographical proximity to the project, and that 
        similar project was subject to environmental review or similar 
        State procedures within the 5 year period immediately preceding 
        the date that the lead agency makes that determination, the 
        lead agency may adopt the environmental document that resulted 
        from that environmental review or similar State procedure. The 
        lead agency may adopt such an environmental document, if it is 
        prepared under State laws and procedures only upon making a 
        favorable determination on such environmental document pursuant 
        to paragraph (2)(A).
    ``(e) Participating Agencies.--
            ``(1) In general.--The lead agency shall be responsible for 
        inviting and designating participating agencies in accordance 
        with this subsection. The lead agency shall provide the 
        invitation or notice of the designation in writing.

        that is required to adopt the environmental document of the 
        lead agency for a project shall be designated as a 
        participating agency and shall collaborate on the preparation 
        of the environmental document, unless the Federal agency 
        informs the lead agency, in writing, by a time specified by the 
        lead agency in the designation of the Federal agency that the

        as practicable in the environmental review for a project, any 
        agencies other than an agency described in paragraph (2) that 
        may have an interest in the project, including, where 
        appropriate, Governors of affected States, and heads of 
        appropriate tribal and local (including county) governments, 
        and shall invite such identified agencies and officials to 
        become participating agencies in the environmental review for 
        the project. The invitation shall set a deadline of 30 days for 
        responses to be submitted, which may only be extended by the 
        lead agency for good cause shown. Any agency that fails to 
        respond prior to the deadline shall be deemed to have declined 
        the invitation.
            ``(4) Effect of declining participating agency 
        invitation.--Any agency that declines a designation or 
        invitation by the lead agency to be a participating agency 
        shall be precluded from submitting comments on any document 
        prepared under NEPA for that project or taking any measures to 
        oppose, based on the environmental review, any permit, license, 
        or approval related to that project.

        be designated by a lead agency as a `cooperating agency' under 
        the regulations contained in part 1500 of title 40, Code of 
        Federal Regulations, as in effect on January 1, 2011. 
        Designation as a cooperating agency shall have no effect on 
        designation as participating agency. No agency that is not a 
        participating agency may be designated as a cooperating agency.

        comments on a project to areas that are within the authority 
        and expertise of such participating agency. Each participating 
        agency shall identify in such comments the statutory authority 
        of the participating agency pertaining to the subject matter of 
        its comments. The lead agency shall not act upon, respond to or 
        include in any document prepared under NEPA, any comment 
        submitted by a participating agency that concerns matters that 
        are outside of the authority and expertise of the commenting 
        participating agency.

            ``(1) Notice.--A project sponsor shall provide the Federal 
        agency responsible for undertaking a project with notice of the 
        initiation of the project by providing a description of the 
        proposed project, the general location of the proposed project, 
        and a statement of any Federal approvals anticipated to be 
        necessary for the proposed project, for the purpose of 
        informing the Federal agency that the environmental review 
        should be initiated.
            ``(2) Lead agency initiation.--The agency receiving a 
        project initiation notice under paragraph (1) shall promptly 
        identify the lead agency for the project, and the lead agency 
        shall initiate the environmental review within a period of 45 
        days after receiving the notice required by paragraph (1) by 
        inviting or designating agencies to become participating 
        agencies, or, where the lead agency determines that no 
        participating agencies are required for the project, by taking 
        such other actions that are reasonable and necessary to 
        initiate the environmental review.
    ``(g) Alternatives Analysis.--
            ``(1) Participation.--As early as practicable during the 
        environmental review, but no later than during scoping for a 
        project requiring the preparation of an environmental impact 
        statement, the lead agency shall provide an opportunity for 
        involvement by cooperating agencies in determining the range of 
        alternatives to be considered for a project.
            ``(2) Range of alternatives.--Following participation under 
        paragraph (1), the lead agency shall determine the range of 
        alternatives for consideration in any document which the lead 
        agency is responsible for preparing for the project, subject to 
        the following limitations:
                    ``(A) No evaluation of certain alternatives.--No 
                Federal agency shall evaluate any alternative that was 
                identified but not carried forward for detailed 
                evaluation in an environmental document or evaluated 
                and not selected in any environmental document prepared 
                under NEPA for the same project.
                    ``(B) Only feasible alternatives evaluated.--Where 
                a project is being constructed, managed, funded, or 
                undertaken by a project sponsor that is not a Federal 
                agency, Federal agencies shall only be required to 
                evaluate alternatives that the project sponsor could 
                feasibly undertake, consistent with the purpose of and 
                the need for the project, including alternatives that 
                can be undertaken by the project sponsor and that are 
                technically and economically feasible.
            ``(3) Methodologies.--
                    ``(A) In general.--The lead agency shall determine, 
                in collaboration with cooperating agencies at 
                appropriate times during the environmental review, the 
                methodologies to be used and the level of detail 
                required in the analysis of each alternative for a 
                project. The lead agency shall include in the 
                environmental document a description of the 
                methodologies used and how the methodologies were 
                selected.
                    ``(B) No evaluation of inappropriate 
                alternatives.--When a lead agency determines that an 
                alternative does not meet the purpose and need for a 
                project, that alternative is not required to be 
                evaluated in detail in an environmental document.
            ``(4) Preferred alternative.--At the discretion of the lead 
        agency, the preferred alternative for a project, after being

                environmental review on the issue on which the party 
                seeks judicial review, and such comment was

 TITLE VI--SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION REGULATORY ACCOUNTABILITY

SEC. 601. SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``SEC Regulatory Accountability 
Act''.

SEC. 602. CONSIDERATION BY THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION OF 
              THE COSTS AND BENEFITS OF ITS REGULATIONS AND CERTAIN 
              OTHER AGENCY ACTIONS.

    Section 23 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78w) 
is amended by adding at the end the following:
    ``(e) Consideration of Costs and Benefits.--
            ``(1) In general.--Before issuing a regulation under the 
        securities laws, as defined in section 3(a), the Commission 
        shall--
                    ``(A) clearly identify the nature and source of the 
                problem that the proposed regulation is designed to 
                address, as well as assess the significance of that 
                problem, to enable assessment of whether any new 
                regulation is warranted;
                    ``(B) utilize the Chief Economist to assess the 
                costs and benefits, both qualitative and quantitative, 
                of the intended regulation and propose or adopt a 
                regulation only on a reasoned determination that the 
                benefits of the intended regulation justify the costs 
                of the regulation;
                    ``(C) identify and assess available alternatives to 
                the regulation that were considered, including 
                modification of an existing regulation, together with 
                an explanation of why the regulation meets the 
                regulatory objectives more effectively than the 
                alternatives; and
                    ``(D) ensure that any regulation is accessible, 
                consistent, written in plain language, and easy to 
                understand and shall measure, and seek to improve, the 
                actual results of regulatory requirements.
            ``(2) Considerations and actions.--
                    ``(A) Required actions.--In deciding whether and 
                how to regulate, the Commission shall assess the costs 
                and benefits of available regulatory alternatives, 
                including the alternative of not regulating, and choose 
                the approach that maximizes net benefits. Specifically, 
                the Commission shall--
                            ``(i) consistent with the requirements of 
                        section 3(f) (15 U.S.C. 78c(f)), section 2(b) 
                        of the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 
                        77b(b)), section 202(c) of the Investment 
                        Advisers Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80b-2(c)), and 
                        section 2(c) of the Investment Company Act of 
                        1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-2(c)), consider whether the 
                        rulemaking will promote efficiency, 
                        competition, and capital formation;
                            ``(ii) evaluate whether, consistent with 
                        obtaining regulatory objectives, the regulation 
                        is tailored to impose the least burden on 
                        society, including market participants, 
                        individuals, businesses of differing sizes, and 
                        other entities (including State and local 
                        governmental entities), taking into account, to 
                        the extent practicable, the cumulative costs of 
                        regulations; and
                            ``(iii) evaluate whether the regulation is 
                        inconsistent, incompatible, or duplicative of 
                        other Federal regulations.
                    ``(B) Additional considerations.--In addition, in 
                making a reasoned determination of the costs and 
                benefits of a potential regulation, the Commission 
                shall, to the extent that each is relevant to the 
                particular proposed regulation, take into consideration 
                the impact of the regulation on--
                            ``(i) investor choice;
                            ``(ii) market liquidity in the securities 
                        markets; and
                            ``(iii) small businesses
            ``(3) Explanation and comments.--The Commission shall 
        explain in its final rule the nature of comments that it 
        received, including those from the industry or consumer groups 
        concerning the potential costs or benefits of the proposed rule 
        or proposed rule change, and shall provide a response to those 
        comments in its final rule, including an explanation of any 
        changes that were made in response to those comments and the 
        reasons that the Commission did not incorporate those industry 
        group concerns related to the potential costs or benefits in 
        the final rule.
            ``(4) Review of existing regulations.--Not later than 1 
        year after the date of enactment of the SEC Regulatory 
        Accountability Act, and every 5 years thereafter, the 
        Commission shall review its regulations to determine whether 
        any such regulations are outmoded, ineffective, insufficient, 
        or excessively burdensome, and shall modify, streamline, 
        expand, or repeal them in accordance with such review. In 
        reviewing any regulation (including, notwithstanding paragraph 
        (6), a regulation issued in accordance with formal rulemaking 
        provisions) that subjects issuers with a public float of 
        $250,000,000 or less to the attestation and reporting 
        requirements of section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 
        2002 (15 U.S.C. 7262(b)), the Commission shall specifically 
        take into account the large burden of such regulation when 
        compared to the benefit of such regulation.
            ``(5) Post-adoption impact assessment.--
                    ``(A) In general.--Whenever the Commission adopts 
                or amends a regulation designated as a `major rule' 
                within the meaning of section 804(2) of title 5, United 
                States Code, it shall state, in its adopting release, 
                the following:

                        quantitative and qualitative metrics to measure 
                        the economic impact of the regulation and to 
                        measure the extent to which the regulation has 
                        accomplished the stated purposes.

                        the Chief Economist of the Commission, to 
                        assess whether the regulation has achieved the 
                        stated purposes.

U.S.C. 78o-3) should also follow the requirements of section 23(e) of 
such Act, as added by this title.

  TITLE VII--CONSIDERATION BY COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION OF 
                       CERTAIN COSTS AND BENEFITS

SEC. 701. CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION OF 
              THE COSTS AND BENEFITS OF ITS REGULATIONS AND ORDERS.

    Section 15(a) of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 19(a)) is 
amended by striking paragraphs (1) and (2) and inserting the following:
            ``(1) In general.--Before promulgating a regulation under 
        this Act or issuing an order (except as provided in paragraph 
        (3)), the Commission, through the Office of the Chief 
        Economist, shall assess the costs and benefits, both 
        qualitative and quantitative, of the intended regulation and 
        propose or adopt a regulation only on a reasoned determination 
        that the benefits of the intended regulation justify the costs 
        of the intended regulation (recognizing that some benefits and 
        costs are difficult to quantify). It must measure, and seek to 
        improve, the actual results of regulatory requirements.
            ``(2) Considerations.--In making a reasoned determination 
        of the costs and the benefits, the Commission shall evaluate--
                    ``(A) considerations of protection of market 
                participants and the public;
                    ``(B) considerations of the efficiency, 
                competitiveness, and financial integrity of futures and 
                swaps markets;
                    ``(C) considerations of the impact on market 
                liquidity in the futures and swaps markets;
                    ``(D) considerations of price discovery;
                    ``(E) considerations of sound risk management 
                practices;
                    ``(F) available alternatives to direct regulation;
                    ``(G) the degree and nature of the risks posed by 
                various activities within the scope of its 
                jurisdiction;
                    ``(H) whether, consistent with obtaining regulatory 
                objectives, the regulation is tailored to impose the 
                least burden on society, including market participants, 
                individuals, businesses of differing sizes, and other 
                entities (including small communities and governmental 
                entities), taking into account, to the extent 
                practicable, the cumulative costs of regulations;
                    ``(I) whether the regulation is inconsistent, 
                incompatible, or duplicative of other Federal 
                regulations;
                    ``(J) whether, in choosing among alternative 
                regulatory approaches, those approaches maximize net 
                benefits (including potential economic, environmental, 
                and other benefits, distributive impacts, and equity); 
                and
                    ``(K) other public interest considerations.''.

                information to the policy decision;
                    (C) except for information that is protected from 
                disclosure by law or administrative practice, the 
                agency makes available to the public the scientific 
                information considered by the agency;
                    (D) the agency gives greatest weight to information 
                that is based on experimental, empirical, quantifiable, 
                and reproducible data that is developed in accordance 
                with well-established scientific processes; and
                    (E) with respect to any proposed rule issued by the 
                agency, such agency follows procedures that include, to 
                the extent feasible and permitted by law, an 
                opportunity for public comment on all relevant 
                scientific findings;
            (2) the agency has procedures in place to make policy 
        decisions only on the basis of the best reasonably obtainable 
        scientific, technical, economic, and other evidence and 
        information concerning the need for, consequences of, and 
        alternatives to the decision; and
            (3) the agency has in place procedures to identify and 
        address instances in which the integrity of scientific 
        information considered by the agency may have been compromised, 
        including instances in which such information may have been the 
        product of a scientific process that was compromised.
    (c) Approval Needed for Policy Decisions to Take Effect.--No policy 
decision issued after January 1, 2013, by an agency subject to this 
section may take effect prior to such date that the agency has in 
effect guidelines under subsection (a) that have been approved by the 
Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy.
    (d) Policy Decisions Not in Compliance.--A policy decision of an 
agency that does not comply with guidelines approved under subsection 
(c) shall be deemed to be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of 
discretion, and otherwise not in accordance with law.
    (e) Definitions.--For purposes of this section:
            (1) Agency.--The term ``agency'' has the meaning given such 
        term in section 551(1) of title 5, United States Code.

                of a substance, product, or activity as hazardous or 
                creating risk to human health, safety, or the
