                               RESOLUTION


 
Commemorating the 70th anniversary and commending the brave men of the 
  17th Bombardment Group (Medium) who became known as the ``Doolittle 
 Tokyo Raiders'' for outstanding heroism, valor, skill, and service to 
the United States in conducting the bombing of Tokyo on April 18, 1942.

Whereas brave American aircraft crewmen, led by Lieutenant Colonel James 
        Doolittle, volunteered for an ``extremely hazardous mission'' without 
        knowing the target, location, or assignment and willingly put their 
        lives in harm's way, risking death, capture, and torture;
Whereas the conducting of medium bomber operations from a Navy aircraft carrier 
        under combat conditions had never before been attempted;
Whereas after the discovery of the USS Hornet by Japanese picket ships 170 miles 
        further away from the prearranged launch point, the Raiders proceeded to 
        take off 670 miles from the coast of Japan;
Whereas by launching more than 100 miles beyond the distance considered to be 
        minimally safe for the mission, the Raiders deliberately accepted the 
        risk that the B-25s might not have enough fuel to reach the designated 
        air-fields in China;
Whereas the additional launch distance greatly increased the risk of crash 
        landing in Japanese occupied China, exposing the crews to higher 
        probability of death, injury, or capture;
Whereas because of that deliberate choice, after bombing their targets in Japan, 
        low on fuel and in setting night and deteriorating weather, none of the 
        16 airplanes reached the prearranged Chinese airfields;
Whereas of the 80 Raiders who launched on the raid, 8 were captured, 2 died in 
        the crash, and 70 returned to the United States; and
Whereas of the 8 captured, 3 were executed and 1 died of disease: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes the valor, skill, and courage of the Raiders 
        that proved invaluable to the eventual defeat of Japan during 
        the Second World War;
            (2) acknowledges that the actions of the Raiders helped to 
        forge an enduring example of heroism in the face of uncertainty 
        for the Army Air Force of the Second World War, the future of 
        the Air Force, and the United States as a whole; and
            (3) commends the 5 living members and 80 original members 
        of the Doolittle Tokyo Raiders for their participation in the 
        Tokyo bombing raid of April 18, 1942.
                                 <all>
