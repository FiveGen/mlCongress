                               RESOLUTION


 
 Honoring Congresswoman Geraldine A. Ferraro, the first woman selected 
 by a major political party as its candidate for Vice President of the 
   United States, and extending the condolences of the Senate on her 
                                 death.

Whereas Congresswoman Geraldine A. Ferraro served the people of the Ninth 
        Congressional District of New York for 6 years;
Whereas Congresswoman Ferraro worked her way through law school at Fordham 
        University, at a time when very few women did so;
Whereas Congresswoman Ferraro then joined the Queens County District Attorney's 
        Office, where she supervised the prosecution of a variety of violent 
        crimes, including child and domestic abuse;
Whereas in 1978, New York's Ninth Congressional District in Queens elected 
        Congresswoman Ferraro to the U.S. House of Representatives, where she 
        was one of only 16 women members of the House;
Whereas when she was nominated as the running mate of Vice President Walter F. 
        Mondale in the 1984 presidential race, Congresswoman Ferraro became the 
        first woman ever chosen to run on the national ticket of either of the 2 
        major political parties of the United States;
Whereas Congresswoman Ferraro's candidacy continues the progress begun by women 
        who achieved political firsts before her and helped to tear down 
        barriers to the full and equal participation of women in national 
        politics;
Whereas in January 1993, President Clinton appointed Ms. Ferraro a United States 
        Ambassador to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, a role from 
        which she championed the rights of women around the world; and
Whereas Geraldine Ferraro's 1984 bid for Vice President helped our daughters 
        join our sons in believing they could achieve anything they set their 
        minds to: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That--
            (1) the Senate recognizes that Geraldine A. Ferraro's vice-
        presidential candidacy forever enriched the American political 
        landscape and forged a new path for women of the United States;
            (2) the Senate pays tribute to Congresswoman Geraldine A. 
        Ferraro's work to improve the lives of women and families not 
        only in the Ninth Congressional District of New York, whom she 
        represented so well, but also the lives of women and families 
        all across the United States;
            (3) the Senate requests the Secretary of the Senate to 
        transmit an enrolled copy of this resolution to the family of 
        Congresswoman Geraldine A. Ferraro; and
            (4) when the Senate adjourns today, it stand adjourned as a 
        further mark of respect to the memory of Congresswoman 
        Geraldine A. Ferraro.
