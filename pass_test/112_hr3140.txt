        centers located in high-risk jurisdictions with mass transit 
        systems in order to enhance the security of such mass transit 
        systems by assisting Federal, State, local, and tribal law

                efficiently to help detect and interdict terrorists, 
                weapons of mass destruction, and contraband at mass 
                transit systems of the United States;
                    ``(B) promote more consistent and timely

                systems; and
