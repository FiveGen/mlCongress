Recognizing the January 12, 2013, opening of the United States Freedom 
Pavilion: The Boeing Center at the National World War II Museum in New 
    Orleans, Louisiana, and supporting plans for other educational 
                       pavilions and initiatives.

Whereas historians Stephen E. Ambrose and Gordon H. ``Nick'' Mueller, among 
        others, founded the National D-Day Museum on June 6, 2000;
Whereas section 8134(c) of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act of 2004 
        (Public Law 108-87; 117 Stat. 1105) designated the National D-Day Museum 
        as ``America's National World War II Museum'';
Whereas the National World War II Museum advances the mission of educating the 
        public about the experience of the United States in World War II, 
        covering all branches of the Armed Forces and the Merchant Marine, and 
        documenting and highlighting activities on both the battlefront and home 
        front;
Whereas the exhibits and programs of the National World War II Museum portray 
        why the War occurred, how the War was won, and what the War means today, 
        and celebrate the spirit of the United States and enduring values 
        displayed during the War;
Whereas the National World War II Museum emphasizes the diverse nature of the 
        war effort of the United States, reflecting the contributions of women, 
        African-Americans, Japanese-Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native 
        Americans, and other groups that have been neglected in many accounts of 
        World War II;
Whereas the 12,000 landing craft designed and built by Higgins Industries in New 
        Orleans made amphibious invasions possible and carried United States 
        soldiers ashore in every theatre and campaign during the War;
Whereas President Dwight D. Eisenhower, the former Supreme Commander of the 
        Allied Expeditionary Forces in Europe, credited Andrew Jackson Higgins, 
        the chief executive officer of Higgins Industries, as the ``man who won 
        the war for us,'' in a 1960s conversation with the preeminent historian 
        Stephen E. Ambrose, leading Ambrose to initiate plans for the National 
        World War II Museum;
Whereas the National D-Day Museum, now known as the ``National World War II 
        Museum'', has made great strides in the development of the facilities, 
        exhibits, and programs at the Museum;
Whereas the National World War II Museum, since the grand opening on June 6, 
        2000, which was the 56th anniversary of the D-Day invasion of Normandy, 
        France, has attracted more than 3,000,000 visitors from across the 
        United States and around the world, and has reached millions more 
        through Internet-based and other distance learning programs;
Whereas World War II veterans and home front supporters, recognized as the 
        ``greatest generation'' because of the sacrifices of the veterans and 
        home front supporters at a pivotal time in United States history, are 
        passing away at a rapid rate, creating an urgent need to preserve the 
        stories, and to pay tribute to the service of the veterans and home 
        front supporters;
Whereas Congress recognizes the need to preserve forever the knowledge and 
        history of the most decisive achievement of the United States during the 
        20th century and to portray that history to citizens, scholars, 
        visitors, and school children for generations to come;
Whereas Congress appropriated funds in 1992 to authorize the design and 
        construction of the National D-Day Museum to commemorate the epic 1944 
        Normandy invasion, and appropriated additional funds in 1998, 2000, 
        2001, 2002, 2003, and 2009 to help expand the Museum to cover the entire 
        experience of the United States in World War II, and the 
        transformational impact on the United States and the world;
Whereas the World War II Memorial on the National Mall in Washington, DC, will 
        always be the symbolic memorial where people come to remember the 
        sacrifices made during World War II;
Whereas the National World War II Museum in New Orleans will always be the 
        educational institution where people come to learn about the monumental 
        struggle by the United States against would-be oppressors, so that 
        future generations can understand the role the United States played in 
        the preservation and advancement of freedom in the middle of the 20th 
        century;
Whereas the State of Louisiana and thousands of donors, including foundations, 
        companies, and Museum members in every State, have contributed millions 
        of dollars and other support to help build and advance the National 
        World War II Museum, and hundreds of volunteers, many from the World War 
        II era, have provided invaluable assistance to the Museum;
Whereas the Board of Trustees of the National World War II Museum, national in 
        scope, and the Presidential Counselors advisory group, featuring leading 
        historians and museum professionals, provide effective guidance and 
        oversight for the National World War II Museum;
Whereas the National World War II Museum continues to add to and maintain 1 of 
        the largest personal history collections in the United States, 
        representing the experiences of the men and women who fought in World 
        War II and served on the home front, with more than 7,000 videotaped, 
        oral, and written accounts in the collection, and plans to digitize the 
        collection to vastly improve public access;
Whereas the National World War II Museum is an official affiliate of the 
        Smithsonian Institution, with a formal agreement to borrow Smithsonian 
        artifacts for exhibits;
Whereas the National World War II Museum collaborates with other museums and 
        memorials in the United States and around the world;
Whereas the National World War II Museum has added major facilities in recent 
        years through donor support, including the Solomon Victory Theater 
        complex, which features a 4-D theater, the Stage Door Canteen, a United 
        Service Organization-styled entertainment venue, and the Kushner 
        Restoration Pavilion, home to a major patrol torpedo boat restoration 
        project;
Whereas the National World War II Museum will open the United States Freedom 
        Pavilion: The Boeing Center in January 2013;
Whereas the Pavilion will feature aircraft such as the B-17 bomber and the P-51 
        fighter, the latter flown by the Tuskegee Airmen, and a submarine 
        experience and exhibits honoring Medal of Honor recipients, government 
        leaders who served in World War II, and industries that became known as 
        the ``Arsenal of Democracy''; and
Whereas other major pavilions and interactive exhibits are planned or under 
        development as the Museum anticipates the completion of the campus by 
        2016, including the Campaigns of Courage: European and Pacific Theaters 
        Pavilion, the Liberation Pavilion, and a Union Station train experience 
        in the original Louisiana Memorial Pavilion: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes and applauds the planned January 12, 2013, 
        opening of the United States Freedom Pavilion: The Boeing 
        Center, an iconic pavilion funded in part by the Federal 
        Government and a major feature of the institution designated by 
        section 8134(c) of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act 
        of 2004 (Public Law 108-87; 117 Stat. 1105) as ``America's 
        National World War II Museum'';
            (2) recognizes the generous assistance from private 
        individuals, corporations, foundations, the Federal Government, 
        the State of Louisiana, and other public entities committed to 
        offering a lasting tribute to the achievements of the United 
        States in World War II; and
            (3) expresses support for the mission of the National World 
        War II Museum as vital to the preservation of democratic 
        values, to the understanding of United States history and 
        founding principles, and to the education of future generations 
        about the relevance of the War experience to the past and 
        future greatness of the United States.
