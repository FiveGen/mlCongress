Whereas the United States Army Air Corps assumed responsibility for military

        to Army and Air Force commanders for the next 75 years;
Whereas the United States Army Air Forces activated the Weather Wing on April 
        14, 1943, in time to provide General Dwight D. Eisenhower with reports 
        and forecasts vital to the success of Operation Overlord, the reentry of 
        the Allies into Europe against resistance from German occupation forces, 
        and subsequent operations in Europe and the Pacific;
Whereas 68 personnel from the Weather Wing lost their lives in World War II;
Whereas the Weather Wing was redesignated as the Army Air Forces Weather Service 
        in 1945, and the Air Weather Service in 1946;
Whereas, in July of 1947, the Air Weather Service became a part of the newly 
        formed United States Air Force with a mission to support both the Army 
        and Air Force;
Whereas, in 1948, the Air Weather Service issued its first tornado warning;
Whereas the Air Weather Service provided critical reports and forecasts to 
        commanders, planners, and aircrews in support of the Berlin Airlift, 
        enabling the successful efforts to stare down Premier of the Soviet 
        Union Joseph Stalin in the first major confrontation of the Cold War;
Whereas the Air Weather Service has participated in every military operation 
        from operations in Vietnam to Iraq and Afghanistan;
Whereas the Air Weather Service was reorganized into a field operating agency on 
        April 1, 1991, reporting directly to the Air Staff;

        Air Force Weather Agency and subsequently headquartered at Offutt Air 
        Force Base, Nebraska;
Whereas, in June 2008, construction was completed on a new 188,000-square-foot 
        headquarters building for the Air Force Weather Agency at Offutt Air 
        Force Base;
Whereas the civilian community surrounding Offutt Air Force Base fully 
        recognizes the tremendous dedication and contributions of the personnel 
        stationed at Offutt Air Force Base to the global fighting force, and 
        likewise, base personnel express constant praise and appreciation to the 
        civilian community for its outstanding support;

        Weather has supported a wide variety of missions from its base in 
        Nebraska, including space launches and solar observation; and
Whereas Air Force Weather has continued to produce timely, accurate, and 
        continuous weather information to locate targets in any battle around 
        the world or in space: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes the 75th anniversary of Air Force Weather 
        and its prominent role in national security;
            (2) remembers the immeasurable contributions of Air Force 
        Weather in protecting the lives of members of the Armed Forces 
        and citizens of the United States through timely and accurate 
        reporting and forecasting; and
            (3) honors the 1,200 personnel who currently serve within 
        Air Force Weather and those who have carried on its tradition 
        of excellence through their continued service at Offutt Air 
        Force Base in Nebraska.
