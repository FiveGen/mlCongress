                               RESOLUTION


 
   Designating May 6, 2011, as ``Military Spouse Appreciation Day''.

Whereas the month of May marks ``National Military Appreciation Month'';
Whereas military spouses provide vital support to men and women in the Armed 
        Forces and help to make the service of such men and women in the Armed 
        Forces possible;
Whereas military spouses have been separated from loved ones because of 
        deployment in support of overseas contingency operations and other 
        military missions carried out by the Armed Forces;
Whereas the establishment of ``Military Spouse Appreciation Day'' is an 
        appropriate way to honor the spouses of members of the Armed Forces; and
Whereas May 6, 2011, would be an appropriate date to establish as ``Military 
        Spouse Appreciation Day'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates May 6, 2011, as ``Military Spouse 
        Appreciation Day'';
            (2) honors and recognizes the contributions made by spouses 
        of members of the Armed Forces; and
            (3) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
        ``Military Spouse Appreciation Day'' to promote awareness of 
        the contributions of spouses of members of the Armed Forces and 
        the importance of the role of military spouses in the lives of 
        members of the Armed Forces and veterans.
