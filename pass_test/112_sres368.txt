   Recognizing the anniversary of the tragic earthquake in Haiti on 
     January 12, 2010, honoring those who lost their lives in that 
  earthquake, and expressing continued solidarity with the people of 
                                 Haiti.

Whereas, on January 12, 2010, an earthquake measuring 7.0 on the Richter scale 
        struck the country of Haiti;
Whereas, according to the United States Geological Survey, the epicenter of the 
        earthquake was located approximately 15 miles southwest of Port-au-
        Prince, the capital of Haiti;
Whereas, according to the Government of Haiti, more than 220,000 people died as 
        a result of the earthquake, and more than 300,000 people were injured;
Whereas, according to the United Nations and the International Organization for 
        Migration an estimated 3,000,000 people, or nearly \1/3\ of the 
        population of Haiti were directly affected by the disaster, and an 
        estimated 1,500,000 people were displaced from their homes;
Whereas a Post Disaster Needs Assessment conducted by the Government of Haiti, 
        the United Nations, the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, 
        and other experts, estimated that damage and economic losses totaled 
        $7,800,000,000, which amounted to approximately 120 percent of the gross 
        domestic product of Haiti in 2009;
Whereas the response of the United States Government, led by the United States 
        Agency for International Development and United States Southern Command, 
        was swift and resolute;
Whereas individuals, businesses, and philanthropic organizations throughout the 
        United States and the international community responded to the crisis by 
        supporting Haiti and its people through innovative ways, such as 
        fundraising through text messaging;
Whereas the Haitian diaspora in the United States was integral to emergency 
        relief efforts and continues to make significant financial contributions 
        to Haiti and seeks opportunities to participate in the rebuilding of 
        Haiti;
Whereas the International Organization for Migration estimates that 
        approximately 550,000 people remain in spontaneous and organized camps 
        in Haiti;
Whereas, at the time of the January 2010 earthquake, Haiti was the poorest, 
        least developed country in the Western Hemisphere, and more than 70 
        percent of the population in Haiti lived on less than $2 per day;
Whereas, before the earthquake, Haiti was making encouraging improvement in 
        recovering from a catastrophic series of hurricanes and tropical storms, 
        food shortages, rising commodity prices, and political instability;
Whereas, in January 21, 2010, the Senate adopted by unanimous consent Senate 
        Resolution 392 (111th Congress), expressing its profound sympathy and 
        unwavering support for the people of Haiti and urging all nations to 
        commit to assisting the people of Haiti with their long-term needs;
Whereas, on October 19, 2010, an outbreak of cholera was detected in the lower 
        Artibonite region of Haiti, which according to the Haitian Ministry of 
        Public Health and Population had affected more than 500,000 people and 
        caused the death of more than 6,700 people nationwide by November 30, 
        2011;
Whereas, as of December 2011, the United States Government had provided 
        technical assistance and contributed more than $73,000,000 in purified 
        drinking water, soap, and oral rehydration salts to combat the spread of 
        cholera in Haiti; and
Whereas, since the January 12, 2010, earthquake, the people of Haiti have 
        demonstrated unwavering resilience, dignity, and courage: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--

        earthquake in Haiti on January 12, 2010;
            (2) honors the service of United States personnel in the 
        United States Embassy in Port-au-Prince, the United States 
        Coast Guard, United States Armed Forces, and other United

        organizations who have persevered through adverse local 
        conditions and continue to serve Haiti and the Haitian people;

        they work to rebuild their country and livelihoods;

        coordination with other donors, in long-term reconstruction;
            (5) urges the United States Government, international 
        donors, and non-governmental organizations in Haiti to work in 
        full partnership with authorities, civil society, and the 
        private sector in Haiti and to prioritize sustainable projects 
        with greater opportunity for capacity building; and
            (6) encourages the United States Government, the Government 
        of Haiti, and international donors--
                    (A) to give priority to policies that would enhance 
                the ability of the Government of Haiti to attract 
                private sector investment and meaningful diaspora 
                participation, including judicial reform, civil 
                registry, enterprise fund, and land tenure reform;
                    (B) to develop, improve, and scale-up 
                communications and participatory mechanisms to more

                stages of the cholera and post-earthquake responses; 
                and
                    (C) to give priority to programs that protect and 
                involve vulnerable populations, including internally 
                displaced persons, children, and persons with 
                disabilities.
