H. Res. 786

                In the House of Representatives, U. S.,

                                                    September 19, 2012.
Whereas, on September 11, 2012, terrorists attacked the United States consulate 
        in Benghazi, Libya, killing four United States citizens, including the 
        United States Ambassador to Libya, John Christopher Stevens, Foreign 
        Service Information Management Officer Sean Smith, and security officers 
        Tyrone S. Woods and Glen A. Doherty, and injured other United States 
        citizens;
Whereas, on September 11, 2012, violent protesters stormed the United States 
        embassy in Cairo, Egypt, committing acts of vandalism and violence and 
        endangering the welfare of United States diplomats;
Whereas, on September 13, 2012, violent protestors were repelled from an attempt 
        to storm the United States embassy in Sana'a, Yemen;
Whereas Ambassador Stevens was a champion of the Libyan people's efforts to 
        remove Muammar Qaddafi from power, and served as Special Envoy to the 
        Libyan Transitional National Council in Benghazi during the 2011 Libyan 
        revolution;
Whereas, on a daily basis, United States diplomats, military personnel, foreign 
        service nationals and locally employed staff, and other public servants 
        make professional and personal sacrifices to faithfully serve the United 
        States and its people to advance the ideals of freedom, democracy, and 
        human dignity around the globe;
Whereas many United States diplomatic facilities remain threatened by terrorist 
        attacks or violent protests in the wake of these attacks; and
Whereas Article 22 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations obligates 
        host governments to ``take all appropriate steps to protect the premises 
        of the [diplomatic] mission against any intrusion or damage and to 
        prevent any disturbance of the peace of the mission or impairment of its 
        dignity.'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes the selfless commitment to United States national 
        security and to Libya's hard-won, transitional democracy by the brave 
        United States citizens who lost their lives in the unjustified attack on 
        the United States consulate in Benghazi, Libya;
            (2) expresses its deepest condolences to the families and loved ones 
        of those United States public servants killed in Benghazi, Libya;
            (3) condemns in the strongest possible terms the terrorists who 
        planned and conducted the attack on the United States consulate in 
        Benghazi, Libya, and those who vandalized the United States embassies in 
        Cairo, Egypt, and Sana'a, Yemen;
            (4) expresses profound concern about the security situation in 
        Libya, Egypt, and Yemen, and with the continuing threat posed to the 
        region and United States interests by extremists and terrorists;
            (5) appreciates the actions of those who sought to protect the 
        United States diplomats and diplomatic facilities;
            (6) reaffirms that nothing can justify terrorism or attacks on 
        innocent civilians and diplomatic personnel;
            (7) calls upon all governments to continue to work closely with the 
        United States Department of State to ensure security of diplomatic 
        facilities throughout their countries, to secure their borders, and to 
        aggressively combat terrorists and extremists who operate within their 
        sovereign territory;
            (8) calls upon the Governments of Libya, Egypt, and Yemen, in full 
        cooperation with the United States Government, to investigate and bring 
        to justice the perpetrators of these attacks; and
            (9) reiterates the United States commitment to promoting its core 
        values, including support for democracy, universal human rights, 
        individual and religious freedom, and respect for human dignity.
            Attest:

                                                                          Clerk.
