                               RESOLUTION


 
Designating June 27, 2012, as ``National Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder 
                            Awareness Day''.

Whereas the brave men and women of the United States Armed Forces, who proudly 
        serve the United States, risk their lives to protect the freedom of the 
        United States and deserve the investment of every possible resource to 
        ensure their lasting physical, mental, and emotional well-being;
Whereas more than 2,000,000 servicemembers have deployed overseas as part of 
        overseas contingency operations since the events of September 11, 2001;
Whereas the military has sustained an operational tempo for a period of time 
        unprecedented in the history of the United States, with many 
        servicemembers deploying multiple times, placing them at high risk of 
        PTSD;
Whereas according to the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center, approximately 
        90,000 servicemembers who have returned from overseas contingency 
        operations have been clinically diagnosed with PTSD;
Whereas the Department of Veterans Affairs reports that--

    (1) since 2002, more than 217,000 of the more than 750,000 veterans of 
overseas contingency operations who have sought care at a Department of 
Veterans Affairs medical center have been diagnosed with PTSD; and

    (2) in fiscal year 2011, more than 475,000 of the nearly 6,000,000 
veterans from all wars who sought care at a Department of Veterans Affairs 
medical center received treatment for PTSD;

Whereas many cases of PTSD remain unreported, undiagnosed, and untreated due to 
        a lack of awareness about PTSD and the persistent stigma associated with 
        mental health issues;
Whereas PTSD significantly increases the risk of depression, suicide, and drug- 
        and alcohol-related disorders and deaths, especially if left untreated;
Whereas perceived or actual symptoms of PTSD or other mental health issues 
        create unique challenges for veterans seeking employment;
Whereas the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs have made significant 
        advances in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of PTSD and the 
        symptoms of PTSD, but many challenges remain; and
Whereas the establishment of a National Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Awareness 
        Day will raise public awareness about issues related to PTSD, reduce the 
        stigma associated with PTSD, and help ensure that those suffering from 
        the invisible wounds of war receive proper treatment: Now, therefore, be 
        it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates June 27, 2012, as ``National Post-Traumatic 
        Stress Disorder Awareness Day'';
            (2) supports the efforts of the Secretary of Veterans 
        Affairs and the Secretary of Defense to educate servicemembers, 
        veterans, the families of servicemembers and veterans, and the 
        public about the causes, symptoms, and treatment of post-
        traumatic stress disorder (referred to in this resolution as 
        ``PTSD''); and
            (3) respectfully requests that the Secretary of the Senate 
        transmit a copy of this resolution to the Secretary of Veterans 
        Affairs and the Secretary of Defense.
                                 <all>
