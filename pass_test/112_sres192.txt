                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                              May 19, 2011

  Mr. Udall of Colorado (for himself, Mr. Burr, Mr. Bingaman, and Ms.

                               agreed to

                               RESOLUTION


 
      Designating May 21, 2011, as ``National Kids to Parks Day''.

Whereas the first National Kids to Parks Day will be celebrated on May 21, 2011;
Whereas the goal of National Kids to Parks Day is to empower young people and 
        encourage families to get outdoors and visit the parks of the United 
        States;
Whereas on National Kids to Parks Day, rural and urban Americans alike can be 
        reintroduced to the splendid National, State, and neighborhood parks 
        that are located in their communities;
Whereas communities across the United States offer a variety of natural 
        resources and public land, often with free access, to individuals 
        seeking outdoor recreation;
Whereas the United States should encourage young people to lead a more active 
        lifestyle, as too many young people in the United States are overweight 
        or obese;
Whereas National Kids to Parks Day is an opportunity for families to take a 
        break from their busy lives and come together for a day of wholesome 
        fun; and
Whereas National Kids to Parks Day aims to broaden the appreciation of young 
        people for nature and the outdoors: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates May 21, 2011, as ``National Kids to Parks 
        Day'';
            (2) recognizes the importance of outdoor recreation and the 
        preservation of open spaces to the health of the young people 
        of the United States; and
            (3) calls on the people of the United States to observe the 
        day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.
                                 <all>
