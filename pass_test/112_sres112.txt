                               RESOLUTION


 
Congratulating the Pennsylvania State University IFC/Panhellenic Dance 
  Marathon (``THON'') on its continued success in support of the Four 
        Diamonds Fund at Penn State Hershey Children's Hospital.

Whereas the Pennsylvania State IFC/Panhellenic Dance Marathon (referred to in 
        this preamble as ``THON'') is the largest student-run philanthropy in 
        the world, with 700 dancers, more than 300 supporting organizations, and 
        more than 15,000 volunteers involved in the annual event;
Whereas student volunteers at the Pennsylvania State University annually collect 
        money and dance for 46 hours straight at the Bryce Jordan Center for 
        THON, bringing energy and excitement to campus for a mission to conquer 
        cancer and awareness about the disease to thousands of individuals;
Whereas all THON activities support the mission of the Four Diamonds Fund at 
        Penn State Hershey Children's Hospital, which provides financial and 
        emotional support to pediatric cancer patients and their families and 
        funds cancer research;
Whereas each year, THON is the single largest donor to the Four Diamonds Fund at 
        Penn State Hershey Children's Hospital, having raised more than 
        $69,000,000 since 1977, when the 2 organizations first became 
        affiliated;
Whereas in 2011, THON set a new fundraising record of $9,563,016.09, besting the 
        previous record of $7,838,054.36, which was set in 2010;
Whereas THON has helped more than 2,000 families through the Four Diamonds Fund, 
        is currently helping to build a new Pediatric Cancer Pavilion at Penn 
        State Hershey Children's Hospital, and has helped support pediatric 
        cancer research that has caused some pediatric cancer survival rates to 
        increase to nearly 90 percent; and
Whereas THON has inspired similar events and organizations across the United 
        States, including at high schools and institutions of higher education, 
        and continues to encourage students across the United States to 
        volunteer and stay involved in great charitable causes in their 
        community: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) congratulates the Pennsylvania State University IFC/
        Panhellenic Dance Marathon (``THON'') on its continued success 
        in support of the Four Diamonds Fund at Penn State Hershey 
        Children's Hospital; and
            (2) commends the Pennsylvania State University students, 
        volunteers, and supporting organizations for their hard work 
        putting together another recordbreaking THON.
                                 <all>
