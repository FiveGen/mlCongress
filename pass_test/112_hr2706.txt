                                 An Act


 
                    To prohibit the sale of billfish.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
    This Act may be cited as the ``Billfish Conservation Act of 2012''.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
    Congress finds the following:
        (1) The United States carefully regulates its domestic 
    fisheries for billfish and participates in international fishery 
    management bodies in the Atlantic and Pacific.
        (2) Global billfish populations have declined significantly, 
    however, because of overfishing primarily through retention of 
    bycatch by non-United States commercial fishing fleets.
        (3) Ending the importation of foreign-caught billfish for sale 
    in the United States aligns with U.S. management measures of 
    billfish and protects the significant economic benefits to the U.S. 
    economy of recreational fishing and marine commerce and the 
    traditional cultural fisheries.
SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY.
    The Congress enacts this Act pursuant to clause 3 of section 8 of 
article I of the Constitution.
