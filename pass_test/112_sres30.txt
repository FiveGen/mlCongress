                               RESOLUTION


 
  Celebrating February 2, 2011, as the 25th anniversary of ``National 
                    Women and Girls in Sports Day''.

Whereas women's athletics are one of the most effective avenues available for 
        the women of the United States to develop self-discipline, initiative, 
        confidence, and leadership skills;
Whereas sports and fitness activities contribute to emotional and physical well-
        being;
Whereas women need strong bodies as well as strong minds;
Whereas the history of women in sports is rich and long, but there has been 
        little national recognition of the significance of the athletic 
        achievements of women;
Whereas there is a need to restore women to leadership positions in athletics to 
        ensure a fair representation of the abilities of women and to provide 
        role models for young female athletes;
Whereas the bonds built between women through athletics help to break down the 
        social barriers of racism and prejudice;
Whereas the communication and cooperation skills learned through athletic 
        experience play a key role in the contributions of an athlete to her 
        home, workplace, and society;
Whereas women's athletics has produced such winners as Flo Hyman, whose spirit, 
        talent, and accomplishments distinguished her above others and who 
        exhibited the true meaning of fairness, determination, and team play;
Whereas parents feel that sports are equally important for boys and girls and 
        that sports and fitness activities provide important benefits to girls 
        who participate;
Whereas early motor-skill training and enjoyable experiences of physical 
        activity strongly influence life-long habits of physical fitness;
Whereas the performances of female athletes in the Olympic Games are a source of 
        inspiration and pride to the people of the United States;
Whereas the athletic opportunities for male students at the collegiate and high 
        school levels remain significantly greater than those for female 
        students; and
Whereas the number of funded research projects focusing on the specific needs of 
        women athletes is limited and the information provided by these projects 
        is imperative to the health and performance of future women athletes: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) celebrates February 2, 2011, as the 25th anniversary of 
        ``National Women and Girls in Sports Day''; and
            (2) encourages State and local jurisdictions, appropriate 
        Federal agencies, and the people of the United States to 
        observe ``National Women and Girls in Sports Day'' with 
        appropriate ceremonies and activities.
                                 <all>
