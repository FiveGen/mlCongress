  Honoring the service and sacrifice of members of the United States 
Armed Forces who are serving in, or have served in, Operation Enduring 
       Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and Operation New Dawn.

Whereas over 2,000,000 members of the United States Armed Forces have deployed 
        to theaters of war since the commencement of Operation Enduring Freedom, 
        Operation Iraqi Freedom, and Operation New Dawn;
Whereas hundreds of thousands of members of the United States Armed Forces have 
        deployed for multiple tours of duty, leaving their homes, their 
        families, and in many cases, their civilian jobs;
Whereas more than 5,500 members of the United States Armed Forces have made the 
        ultimate sacrifice for the United States while serving in Iraq or 
        Afghanistan;
Whereas tens of thousands of members of the United States Armed Forces have been 
        seriously wounded in the line of duty while serving in Iraq or 
        Afghanistan;
Whereas the members of the United States Armed Forces who have participated in 
        Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and Operation New 
        Dawn have answered the call to duty of the United States, serving 
        bravely and nobly and, in most cases, without fanfare or acclaim;
Whereas those members of the United States Armed Forces and veterans have 
        personified the virtues of patriotism, service, duty, courage, and 
        sacrifice; and
Whereas the people of the United States recognize the service and sacrifices 
        made by those members of the United States Armed Forces and veterans, as 
        well as their families: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring), 
That Congress--
            (1) honors the members of the United States Armed Forces 
        who are serving in, or have served in, Operation Enduring 
        Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and Operation New Dawn; and
            (2) calls on the people of the United States to reflect on 
        the service of those members of the United States Armed Forces 
        and veterans and to hold those members and veterans in a 
        special place of honor, both now and in the future.

            Passed the Senate May 25, 2011.

            Attest:

                                                NANCY ERICKSON,

                                                             Secretary.
