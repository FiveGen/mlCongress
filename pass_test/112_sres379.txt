                               RESOLUTION


 
   Condemning violence by the Government of Syria against the Syrian 
                                people.

Whereas the Syrian Arab Republic is a party to the International Covenant on 
        Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), adopted at New York December 16, 
        1966, the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, 
        Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, done at New York December 
        10, 1984;
Whereas Syria voted in favor of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
        adopted at Paris, December 10, 1948;
Whereas, in March 2011, peaceful demonstrations in Syria began against the 
        authoritarian rule of Bashar al-Assad;
Whereas, in response to the demonstrations, the Government of Syria launched a 
        brutal crackdown, which has resulted in gross human rights violations, 
        use of force against civilians, torture, extrajudicial killings, 
        arbitrary executions, sexual violence, and interference with access to 
        medical treatment;
Whereas the United Nations, as of January 25, 2012, estimated that more than 
        5,400 people in Syria have been killed since the violence began in March 
        2011;
Whereas, on February 4, 2012, President Barack Obama stated that President 
        Bashar al-Assad ``has no right to lead Syria, and has lost all 
        legitimacy with his people and the international community'';
Whereas the Department of State has repeatedly condemned the Government of 
        Syria's crackdown on its people, including on January 30, 2012, when 
        Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stated ``The status quo is 
        unsustainable. . .The longer the Assad regime continues its attacks on 
        the Syrian people and stands in the way of a peaceful transition, the 
        greater the concern that instability will escalate and spill over 
        throughout the region.'';
Whereas President Obama, on April 29, 2011, designated 3 individuals subject to 
        sanctions for humans rights abuses in Syria: Mahir al-Assad, the brother 
        of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and brigade commander in the Syrian 
        Army's 4th Armored Division; Atif Najib, the former head of the 
        Political Security Directorate for Daraa Province and a cousin of Bashar 
        al-Assad; and Ali Mamluk, director of Syria's General Intelligence 
        Directorate;
Whereas, on May 18, 2011, President Obama issued an executive order sanctioning 
        senior officials of the Syrian Arab Republic and their supporters, 
        specifically designating 7 people: President Bashar al-Assad, Vice 
        President Farouk al-Shara, Prime Minister Adel Safar, Minister of the 
        Interior Mohammad Ibrahim al-Shaar, Minister of Defense Ali Habib 
        Mahmoud, Head of Syrian Military Intelligence Abdul Fatah Qudsiya, and 
        Director of Political Security Directorate Mohammed Dib Zaitoun;
Whereas President Obama, on August 17, 2011, issued Executive Order 13582, 
        blocking property of the Government of Syria and prohibiting certain 
        transactions with respect to Syria;
Whereas, on December 1, 2011, the Department of the Treasury designated 2 
        individuals, Aus Aslan and Muhammad Makhluf, under Executive Order 13573 
        and 2 entities, the Military Housing Establishment and the Real Estate 
        Bank of Syria, under Executive Order 13582;
Whereas, on May 6, 2011, the European Union's 27 countries imposed sanctions on 
        the Government of Syria for the human rights abuses, including asset 
        freezes and visa bans on members of the Government of Syria and an arms 
        embargo on the country;
Whereas, on November 12, 2011, the League of Arab States voted to suspend 
        Syria's membership in the organization;
Whereas, on December 2, 2011, the United Nations Human Rights Council passed 
        Resolution S-18/1, which deplores the human rights situation in Syria, 
        commends the League of Arab States, and supports implementation of its 
        Plan of Action;
Whereas the League of Arab States approved and implemented a plan of action to 
        send a team of international monitors to Syria, which began December 26, 
        2011;
Whereas, on January 28, 2012, the League of Arab States decided to suspend its 
        international monitoring mission due to escalating violence within 
        Syria;
Whereas, on February 4, 2012, the Russian Federation and People's Republic of 
        China vetoed a United Nations Security Council Resolution in support of 
        the League of Arab States' Plan of Action;
Whereas, on February 14, 2012, General Martin Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint 
        Chiefs of Staff, testified before the Committee on Armed Services of the 
        Senate that Syria ``is a much different situation than we collectively 
        saw in Libya,'' presenting a ``very different challenge'' in which ``we 
        also know that other regional actors are providing support'' as a part 
        of a ``Sunni majority rebelling against an oppressive Alawite-Shia 
        regime'';
Whereas the Governments of the Russian Federation and the Islamic Republic of 
        Iran remain major suppliers of military equipment to the Government of 
        Syria notwithstanding that government's violent repression of 
        demonstrators;
Whereas the gross human rights violations perpetuated by the Government of Syria 
        against the people of Syria represent a grave risk to regional peace and 
        stability; and
Whereas the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate will immediately 
        schedule a hearing to take place as soon as the Senate reconvenes to 
        assess the situation in Syria and all the international options 
        available to address this crisis: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) strongly condemns the Government of Syria's brutal and 
        unjustifiable use of force against civilians, including unarmed 
        women and children and its violations of the fundamental human 
        rights and dignity of the people of Syria;
            (2) expresses its solidarity with the people of Syria, who 
        have exhibited remarkable courage and determination in the face 
        of unspeakable violence to rid themselves of a brutal 
        dictatorship;
            (3) expresses strong disappointment with the Governments of 
        the Russian Federation and the People's Republic of China for 
        their veto of the United Nations Security Council resolution 
        condemning Bashar al-Assad and the violence in Syria and urges 
        them to reconsider their votes;
            (4) encourages the members of the United Nations Security 
        Council to continue to pursue a resolution in support of a 
        political solution to the crisis in Syria;
            (5) commends the League of Arab States' efforts to bring 
        about a peaceful resolution in Syria;
            (6) regrets that the League of Arab States observer mission 
        was not able to monitor the full implementation of the League 
        of Arab States' Action Plan of November 2, 2011, due to the 
        escalating violence in Syria; and
            (7) urges the international community to review legal 
        processes available to hold officials of the Government of 
        Syria accountable for crimes against humanity and gross 
        violations of human rights.
                                 <all>
