                      One Hundred Twelfth Congress

                                 of the

                          AT THE SECOND SESSION

                          Concurrent Resolution

Whereas enslaved African-Americans provided labor essential to the 
  construction of the United States Capitol;

Whereas in 2005 Congress created the Slave Labor Task Force to study 
  the role that enslaved African-Americans played in the construction 
  of the Capitol and to make recommendations to Congress on how to 
  commemorate their contribution;

Whereas the report of the Architect of the Capitol entitled ``History 
  of Slave Laborers in the Construction of the United States Capitol'' 
  documents the role of slave labor in the construction of the Capitol;

Whereas enslaved African-Americans performed the backbreaking work of 
  quarrying the stone which comprised many of the floors, walls, and 
  columns of the Capitol;

Whereas enslaved African-Americans also participated in other facets of 
  construction of the Capitol, including carpentry, masonry, carting, 
  rafting, roofing, plastering, glazing, painting, and sawing;

Whereas the marble columns in the Old Senate Chamber and the sandstone 
  walls of the East Front corridor remain as the lasting legacies of 
  the enslaved African-Americans who worked the quarries;

Whereas slave-quarried stones from the remnants of the original Capitol 
  walls can be found in Rock Creek Park in the District of Columbia;

Whereas the Statue of Freedom now atop the Capitol dome could not have 
  been cast without the pivotal intervention of Philip Reid, an 
  enslaved African-American foundry worker who deciphered the puzzle of 
  how to separate the 5-piece plaster model for casting when all others 
  failed;

Whereas the great hall of the Capitol Visitor Center was named 
  Emancipation Hall to help acknowledge the work of the slave laborers 
  who built the Capitol;

Whereas no narrative on the construction of the Capitol that does not 
  include the contribution of enslaved African-Americans can fully and 
  accurately reflect its history;

Whereas recognition of the contributions of enslaved African-Americans 
  brings to all Americans an understanding of the continuing evolution 
  of our representative democracy;

Whereas in 2007 the Slave Labor Task Force recommended to Congress the 
  creation of a marker commemorating the contributions of enslaved 
  African-Americans in the construction of the Capitol; and

Whereas the marker dedicated to the enslaved African-Americans who 
  helped to build the Capitol reflects the charge of the Capitol 
  Visitor Center to teach visitors about Congress and its development: 
  Now, therefore, be it

    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring),
