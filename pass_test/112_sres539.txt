                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                             August 1, 2012

 Mr. Rockefeller (for himself, Mr. Alexander, and Mr. Levin) submitted 
      the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
        Designating October 13, 2012, as ``National Chess Day''.

Whereas there are more than 80,000 members of the United States Chess Federation 
        (referred to in this preamble as the ``Federation''), and an unknown 
        number of additional people in the United States who play chess without 
        joining an official organization;
Whereas approximately \1/2\ of the members of the Federation are members of 
        scholastic chess programs, and many of those members join the Federation 
        by the age of 10;
Whereas the Federation is very supportive of scholastic chess programs and 
        sponsors a Certified Chess Coach program that provides the coaches 
        involved in the scholastic chess programs with training and ensures 
        schools and students can have confidence in the programs;
Whereas many studies have linked scholastic chess programs to the improvement of 
        students' scores in reading and math, as well as improved self-esteem;
Whereas the Federation offers guidance to educators to help incorporate chess 
        into the school curriculum;
Whereas chess is a powerful cognitive learning tool that can be used to 
        successfully enhance students' reading skills and understanding of math 
        concepts; and
Whereas chess engages students of all learning styles and strengths and promotes 
        problem-solving and higher-level thinking skills: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates October 13, 2012, as ``National Chess Day'' 
        to enhance awareness and encourage students and adults to play 
        chess, a game known to enhance critical-thinking and problem-
        solving skills; and
            (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
        National Chess Day with appropriate programs and activities.
                                 <all>
