                               RESOLUTION


 
  Commemorating the 110th anniversary of the United States Army Nurse 
                                 Corps.

Whereas throughout the history of the United States, nurses have served the 
        United States Armed Forces during times of peace and war;
Whereas the establishment of the United States Army Nurse Corps (referred to in 
        this preamble as the ``Army Nurse Corps''), a permanent nursing corps, 
        was authorized under section 19 of the Act of February 2, 1901 (31 Stat. 
        753, chapter 192);
Whereas for the 110 years since its establishment, the Army Nurse Corps has 
        served with distinction at home and abroad;
Whereas more than 21,000 Army nurses served in World War I, providing care in 
        evacuation, mobile surgical hospitals, and on hospital trains and 
        transport ships;
Whereas in World War II, more than 57,000 Army nurses served with distinction, 
        including 67 nurses who were captured in the Philippines and held as 
        prisoners of war for 3 years before their liberation in February 1945;
Whereas Army nurses have served with the United States Army in hostilities in 
        Korea, Vietnam, Grenada, Panama, Kuwait, and Somalia;
Whereas Army nurses have served shoulder to shoulder with the United States Army 
        for more than 9 years in Afghanistan and 7 years in Iraq;
Whereas as of the date of agreement to this resolution, nurses in the Army 
        Reserve, the Army National Guard, and the Regular Army are deployed in 
        more than 15 countries;
Whereas the motto of Army nurses, ``Embrace the Past, Engage the Present, 
        Envision the Future'', symbolizes the bond of the Army Nurse Corps to 
        its rich history as well as its commitment to the care of future 
        generations of Americans;
Whereas Army nurses, who selflessly serve the United States, will continue to 
        serve the United States Army, regardless of the cause, location, or 
        magnitude of future battles; and
Whereas the Army Nurse Corps is committed to providing quality care to the 
        United States Army during times of peace and war, at any time and in any 
        place: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes the valor, commitment, and sacrifice that 
        United States Army Nurse Corps nurses have made throughout the 
        history of the United States;
            (2) commends the United States Army Nurse Corps for 110 
        years of selfless service; and
            (3) calls upon the people of the United States to observe 
        that anniversary with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
                                 <all>
