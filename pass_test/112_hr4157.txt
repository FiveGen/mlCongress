                                 AN ACT


 
  To prohibit the Secretary of Labor from reissuing or issuing a rule 
 substantially similar to a certain proposed rule under the Fair Labor 
             Standards Act of 1938 relating to child labor.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE AND FINDINGS.

    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Preserving 
America's Family Farms Act''.
    (b) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) family farms have a long history and tradition of 
        providing youth with valuable work experience;
            (2) Department of Labor regulations should not adversely 
        impact the longstanding tradition of youth working on farms 
        where they can gain valuable skills and lessons on hard work, 
        character, and leadership;
            (3) the Department of Labor's proposed regulations would 
        have curtailed opportunities for youth to gain experiential 
        learning and hands-on skills for enrollment in vocational 
        agricultural training;
            (4) the proposed regulations would have obstructed the 
        opportunity for youth to find rewarding employment and earn 
        money for a college education or other meaningful purposes;
            (5) the proposed regulations would have limited 
        opportunities for young farmers wishing to pursue a career in 
        agriculture at a time when the average age of farmers continues 
        to rise; and
            (6) working on a farm has become a way of life for 
        thousands of youth across the rural United States.

SEC. 2. RULE RELATING TO CHILD LABOR.

    The Secretary of Labor shall not reissue in substantially the same 
form, or issue a new rule that is substantially the same as, the 
proposed rule entitled ``Child Labor Regulations, Orders and Statements 
of Interpretation; Child Labor Violations--Civil Money Penalties'' 
(published at 76 Fed. Reg. 54836 (September 2, 2011)).

            Passed the House of Representatives July 24, 2012.

            Attest:

                                                 KAREN L. HAAS,

                                                                 Clerk.
