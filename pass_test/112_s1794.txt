        posted, cordoned off, or otherwise restricted area--
                    ``(A) of the White House or its grounds, or the 
                Vice President's official residence or its grounds;
                    ``(B) of a building or grounds where the President 
                or other person protected by the Secret Service is or 
                will be temporarily visiting; or
                    ``(C) of a building or grounds so restricted in
