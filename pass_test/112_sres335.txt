                               RESOLUTION


 
           Honoring the life and legacy of Evelyn H. Lauder.

Whereas with the passing of Evelyn H. Lauder, the world has lost an energetic 
        and dedicated friend and ally who catapulted to the world stage the 
        quest to prevent and cure breast cancer in this lifetime;
Whereas Evelyn was born Evelyn Hausner on August 12, 1936, in Vienna, Austria;
Whereas in 1940, the Hausner family fled Nazi-occupied Austria, eventually 
        settling in the State of New York, where Eveyln was a proud product of 
        the New York City public school system and met her future husband of 
        more than half a century, Leonard Lauder;
Whereas Evelyn and Leonard wed in July 1959;
Whereas, Evelyn joined the family cosmetic company, Estee Lauder, handling many 
        roles in the early years and later becoming Senior Corporate Vice 
        President and Head of Fragrance Development Worldwide;
Whereas Evelyn helped bring global awareness to breast cancer after being 
        diagnosed with early stages of the disease in 1987;
Whereas in 1989, Evelyn initiated the fundraising drive to establish the Evelyn 
        H. Lauder Breast Cancer Center at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center 
        in New York City, which opened in 1992 and quickly became the model for 
        similar breast cancer diagnostic centers around the world;
Whereas the expanded Evelyn H. Lauder Breast Cancer Center opened in 2009 and 
        provides the most up-to-date breast cancer prevention, diagnosis, and 
        outpatient treatment services under 1 roof;
Whereas in 1992, Evelyn worked with longtime friend Alexandra Penney, former 
        editor-in-chief of SELF magazine, to create the Pink Ribbon Campaign for 
        breast cancer;
Whereas Evelyn launched the Estee Lauder Companies' Breast Cancer Awareness 
        Campaign, which has distributed more than 115,000,000 pink ribbons 
        worldwide;
Whereas in 1993, Evelyn founded The Breast Cancer Research Foundation, thereby 
        affirming her commitment to preventing breast cancer and finding a cure 
        in this lifetime through funding some of the most innovative clinical 
        and translation research at leading medical centers worldwide;
Whereas The Breast Center Research Foundation, which to date funds 186 
        researchers around the world and has raised $350,000,000, has grown to 
        become the largest national organization dedicated exclusively to 
        funding research relating to the causes, treatment and prevention of 
        breast cancer;
Whereas during Breast Cancer Awareness Month in October 2010, Evelyn and the 
        Estee Lauder Companies' Breast Cancer Awareness Campaign achieved a 
        first-ever Guinness World Record, ``Most Landmarks Illuminated for a 
        Cause in 24 Hours'', by illuminating 38 iconic landmarks, including the 
        Taj Mahal, the Tokyo Tower, the Hotel Majestic, the Empire State 
        Building, and Niagara Falls;
Whereas in October 2011, the Lauder family was honored with the prestigious 
        Carnegie Medal of Philanthropy for commitment to philanthropic endeavors 
        and public service;
Whereas Evelyn will be remembered for her vision and leadership in achieving 
        funding for promising scientific research that lead to breakthrough 
        drugs, including Herceptin and Avastin, a better understanding of how 
        tumors develop and risk factors for recurrence, and an improved quality 
        of life for breast cancer survivors;
Whereas her work continues to help promising scientists who have equally 
        promising, imaginative, and innovative proposals get research off the 
        ground;
Whereas there is no doubt that we must find a cure, and research is instrumental 
        to achieving this goal;
Whereas this year, nearly 40,000 women of the United States are expected to die 
        of breast cancer; and
Whereas we must keep up the battle and recruit more heroes like Evelyn if we are 
        to achieve ``prevention and a cure in our lifetime'': Now, therefore, be 
        it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) mourns the loss of Evelyn H. Lauder;
            (2) honors the life and accomplishments of Evelyn H. 
        Lauder, a world renowned advocate for breast cancer awareness 
        and health of women; and
            (3) offers the deepest condolences to the beloved husband, 
        Leonard, sons, William and Gary, and 5 grandchildren of Evelyn 
        H. Lauder.
