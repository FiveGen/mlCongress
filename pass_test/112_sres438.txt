                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                             April 25, 2012

   Mr. Lautenberg (for himself, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Thune, and Mr.

                               agreed to

                               RESOLUTION


 
    To support the goals and ideals of National Safe Digging Month.

Whereas each year, the underground utility infrastructure of the United States, 
        including pipelines, electric, gas, telecommunications, water, sewer, 
        and cable television lines, is jeopardized by unintentional damage 
        caused by those who fail to have underground lines located prior to 
        digging;
Whereas some utility lines are buried only a few inches underground, making the 
        lines easy to strike, even during shallow digging projects;
Whereas digging prior to locating underground utility lines often results in 
        unintended consequences, such as service interruption, environmental 
        damage, personal injury, and even death;
Whereas the month of April marks the beginning of the peak period during which 
        excavation projects are carried out around the United States;
Whereas in 2002, Congress required the Department of Transportation and the 
        Federal Communications Commission to establish a 3-digit, nationwide, 
        toll-free number to be used by State ``One Call'' systems to provide 
        information on underground utility lines;
Whereas in 2005, the Federal Communications Commission designated ``811'' as the 
        nationwide ``One Call'' number for homeowners and excavators to use to 
        obtain information on underground utility lines before conducting 
        excavation activities;
Whereas ``One Call'' has helped reduce the number of digging damages caused by 
        failure to call before digging from 48 percent in 2004 to 32 percent in 
        2010;
Whereas the 1,400 members of the Common Ground Alliance, who are dedicated to 
        ensuring public safety, environmental protection, and the integrity of 
        services, promote the national ``Call Before You Dig'' campaign to 
        increase public awareness about the importance of homeowners and 
        excavators calling 811 to find out the exact location of underground 
        lines; and
Whereas the Common Ground Alliance has designated April as ``National Safe 
        Digging Month'' to increase awareness of safe digging practices across 
        the United States and to celebrate the anniversary of 811, the national 
        ``Call Before You Dig'' number:
Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of National Safe Digging 
        Month; and
            (2) encourages all homeowners and excavators throughout the 
        United States to call 811 before digging.
                                 <all>
