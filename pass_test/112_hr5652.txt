            Subtitle B--Home Affordable Modification Program

SEC. 321. SHORT TITLE.

    This subtitle may be cited as the ``HAMP Termination Act of 2012''.

SEC. 322. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) According to the Department of the Treasury--
                    (A) the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) 
                is designed to ``help as many as 3 to 4 million 
                financially struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure by 
                modifying loans to a level that is affordable for 
                borrowers now and sustainable over the long term''; and
                    (B) as of February 2012, only 782,609 active 
                permanent mortgage modifications were made under HAMP.
            (2) Many homeowners whose HAMP modifications were canceled 
        suffered because they made futile payments and some of those 
        homeowners were even forced into foreclosure.
            (3) The Special Inspector General for TARP reported that 
        HAMP ``benefits only a small portion of distressed homeowners, 
        offers others little more than false hope, and in certain cases 
        causes more harm than good''.
            (4) Approximately $30 billion was obligated by the 
        Department of the Treasury to HAMP, however, approximately only 
        $2.54 billion has been disbursed.
            (5) Terminating HAMP would save American taxpayers 
        approximately $2.84 billion, according to the Congressional 
        Budget Office.

SEC. 323. TERMINATION OF AUTHORITY.

    Section 120 of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (12 
U.S.C. 5230) is amended by adding at the end the following new 
subsection:
    ``(c) Termination of Authority To Provide New Assistance Under the 
Home Affordable Modification Program.--
            ``(1) In general.--Except as provided under paragraph (2), 
        after the date of the enactment of this subsection the 
        Secretary may not provide any assistance under the Home 
        Affordable Modification Program under the Making Home 
        Affordable initiative of the Secretary, authorized under this 
        Act, on behalf of any homeowner.
            ``(2) Protection of existing obligations on behalf of 
        homeowners already extended an offer to participate in the 
        program.--Paragraph (1) shall not apply with respect to 
        assistance provided on behalf of a homeowner who, before the 
        date of the enactment of this subsection, was extended an offer 
        to participate in the Home Affordable Modification Program on a 
        trial or permanent basis.
            ``(3) Deficit reduction.--

                any other provision of this title, the amounts 
                described in subparagraph (B) shall not be available

                obligation or expenditure under the Home Affordable 
                Modification Program of the Secretary, but should be

                        be provided assistance after the date of the 
                        enactment of this subsection.
            ``(4) Study of use of program by members of the armed 
        forces, veterans, and gold star recipients.--
                    ``(A) Study.--The Secretary shall conduct a study 
                to determine the extent of usage of the Home Affordable 
                Modification Program by, and the impact of such Program 
                on, covered homeowners.
                    ``(B) Report.--Not later than the expiration of the 
                90-day period beginning on the date of the enactment of

                Congress a report setting forth the results of the 
                study under subparagraph (A) and identifying best 
                practices, derived from studying the Home Affordable 
                Modification Program, that could be applied to existing 
                mortgage assistance programs available to covered 
                homeowners.

SEC. 324. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

        paragraph (1)(H), the Administrator shall ensure that the 
        membership of the Council has a balance of Federal, State, 
        local, and private members, and includes an adequate number of 
        representatives from the States with coastline on the Gulf of 
        Mexico and other States containing areas identified by the 
        Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency as at 
        high-risk for flooding or special flood hazard areas.
    (c) Duties.--
            (1) New mapping standards.--Not later than the expiration 
        of the 12-month period beginning upon the date of the enactment 
        of this Act, the Council shall develop and submit to the 
        Administrator and the Congress proposed new mapping standards 
        for 100-year flood insurance rate maps used under the national 
        flood insurance program under the National Flood Insurance Act 
        of 1968. In developing such proposed standards the Council 
        shall--
                    (A) ensure that the flood insurance rate maps 
                reflect true risk, including graduated risk that better 
                reflects the financial risk to each property; such 
                reflection of risk should be at the smallest geographic 
                level possible (but not necessarily property-by-
                property) to ensure that communities are mapped in a 
                manner that takes into consideration different risk 
                levels within the community;
                    (B) ensure the most efficient generation, display, 
                and distribution of flood risk data, models, and maps 
                where practicable through dynamic digital environments 
                using spatial database technology and the Internet;
                    (C) ensure that flood insurance rate maps reflect 
                current hydrologic and hydraulic data, current land 
                use, and topography, incorporating the most current and 
                accurate ground and bathymetric elevation data;
                    (D) determine the best ways to include in such 
                flood insurance rate maps levees, decertified levees, 
                and areas located below dams, including determining a 
                methodology for ensuring that decertified levees and 
                other protections are included in flood insurance rate 
                maps and their corresponding flood zones reflect the 
                level of protection conferred;
                    (E) consider how to incorporate restored wetlands 
                and other natural buffers into flood insurance rate 
                maps, which may include wetlands, groundwater recharge 
                areas, erosion zones, meander belts, endangered species 
                habitat, barrier islands and shoreline buffer features, 
                riparian forests, and other features;
                    (F) consider whether to use vertical positioning 
                (as defined by the Administrator) for flood insurance 
                rate maps;
                    (G) ensure that flood insurance rate maps 
                differentiate between a property that is located in a 
                flood zone and a structure located on such property 
                that is not at the same risk level for flooding as such 
                property due to the elevation of the structure;
                    (H) ensure that flood insurance rate maps take into 
                consideration the best scientific data and potential 
                future conditions (including projections for sea level 
                rise); and
                    (I) consider how to incorporate the new standards 
                proposed pursuant to this paragraph in existing mapping 
                efforts.
            (2) Ongoing duties.--The Council shall, on an ongoing 
        basis, review the mapping protocols developed pursuant to 
        paragraph (1), and make recommendations to the Administrator 
        when the Council determines that mapping protocols should be 
        altered.
            (3) Meetings.--In carrying out its duties under this 
        section, the Council shall consult with stakeholders through at 
        least 4 public meetings annually, and shall seek input of all 
        stakeholder interests including State and local 
        representatives, environmental and conservation organizations, 
        insurance industry representatives, advocacy groups, planning 
        organizations, and mapping organizations.
    (d) Prohibition on Compensation.--Members of the Council shall 
receive no additional compensation by reason of their service on the 
Council.
    (e) Chairperson.--The Administrator shall serve as the Chairperson 
of the Council.
    (f) Staff.--
            (1) FEMA.--Upon the request of the Council, the 
        Administrator may detail, on a nonreimbursable basis, personnel 
        of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to assist the 
        Council in carrying out its duties.
            (2) Other federal agencies.--Upon request of the Council, 
        any other Federal agency that is a member of the Council may 
        detail, on a non-reimbursable basis, personnel to assist the 
        Council in carrying out its duties.
    (g) Powers.--In carrying out this section, the Council may hold 
hearings, receive evidence and assistance, provide information, and 
conduct research, as the Council considers appropriate.
    (h) Termination.--The Council shall terminate upon the expiration 
of the 5-year period beginning on the date of the enactment of this 
Act.
    (i) Moratorium on Flood Map Changes.--
            (1) Moratorium.--Except as provided in paragraph (2) and 
        notwithstanding any other provision of this subtitle, the 
        National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, or the Flood Disaster 
        Protection Act of 1973, during the period beginning upon the 
        date of the enactment of this Act and ending upon the 
        submission by the Council to the Administrator and the Congress 
        of the proposed new mapping standards required under subsection 
        (c)(1), the Administrator may not make effective any new or 
        updated rate maps for flood insurance coverage under the 
        national flood insurance program that were not in effect for 
        such program as of such date of enactment, or otherwise revise, 
        update, or change the flood insurance rate maps in effect for 
        such program as of such date.
            (2) Letters of map change.--During the period described in 
        paragraph (1), the Administrator may revise, update, and change 
        the flood insurance rate maps in effect for the national flood 
        insurance program only pursuant to a letter of map change 
        (including a letter of map amendment, letter of map revision,

SEC. 347. FEMA INCORPORATION OF NEW MAPPING PROTOCOLS.

    (a) New Rate Mapping Standards.--Not later than the expiration of 
the 6-month period beginning upon submission by the Technical Mapping 
Advisory Council under section 346 of the proposed new mapping 
standards for flood insurance rate maps used under the national flood 
insurance program developed by the Council pursuant to section 346(c), 
the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (in this 
section referred to as the ``Administrator'') shall establish new 
standards for such rate maps based on such proposed new standards and 
the recommendations of the Council.
    (b) Requirements.--The new standards for flood insurance rate maps 
established by the Administrator pursuant to subsection (a) shall--
            (1) delineate and include in any such rate maps--
                    (A) all areas located within the 100-year flood 
                plain; and
                    (B) areas subject to graduated and other risk 
                levels, to the maximum extent possible;
            (2) ensure that any such rate maps--
                    (A) include levees, including decertified levees, 
                and the level of protection they confer;
                    (B) reflect current land use and topography and 
                incorporate the most current and accurate ground level 
                data;
                    (C) take into consideration the impacts and use of 
                fill and the flood risks associated with altered 
                hydrology;
                    (D) differentiate between a property that is 
                located in a flood zone and a structure located on such 
                property that is not at the same risk level for 
                flooding as such property due to the elevation of the 
                structure;
                    (E) identify and incorporate natural features and 
                their associated flood protection benefits into mapping 
                and rates; and
                    (F) identify, analyze, and incorporate the impact 
                of significant changes to building and development 
                throughout any river or costal water system, including 
                all tributaries, which may impact flooding in areas 
                downstream; and
            (3) provide that such rate maps are developed on a 
        watershed basis.
    (c) Report.--If, in establishing new standards for flood insurance 
rate maps pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the Administrator 
does not implement all of the recommendations of the Council made under 
the proposed new mapping standards developed by the Council pursuant to 
section 346(c), upon establishment of the new standards the 
Administrator shall submit a report to the Committee on Financial 
Services of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Banking, 
Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate specifying which such 
recommendations were not adopted and explaining the reasons such 
recommendations were not adopted.
    (d) Implementation.--The Administrator shall, not later than the 
expiration of the 6-month period beginning upon establishment of the 
new standards for flood insurance rate maps pursuant to subsection (a) 
of this section, commence use of the new standards and updating of 
flood insurance rate maps in accordance with the new standards. Not 
later than the expiration of the 10-year period beginning upon the 
establishment of such new standards, the Administrator shall complete 
updating of all flood insurance rate maps in accordance with the new 
standards, subject to the availability of sufficient amounts for such 
activities provided in appropriation Acts.
    (e) Temporary Suspension of Mandatory Purchase Requirement for 
Certain Properties.--
            (1) Submission of elevation certificate.--Subject to 
        paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection, subsections (a), 
        (b), and (e) of section 102 of the Flood Disaster Protection 
        Act of 1973 (42 U.S.C. 4012a), and section 202(a) of such Act, 
        shall not apply to a property located in an area designated as 
        having a special flood hazard if the owner of such property 
        submits to the Administrator an elevation certificate for such 
        property showing that the lowest level of the primary residence 
        on such property is at an elevation that is at least three feet 
        higher than the elevation of the 100-year flood plain.
            (2) Review of certificate.--The Administrator shall accept 
        as conclusive each elevation certificate submitted under 
        paragraph (1) unless the Administrator conducts a subsequent 
        elevation survey and determines that the lowest level of the 
        primary residence on the property in question is not at an 
        elevation that is at least three feet higher than the elevation 
        of the 100-year flood plain. The Administrator shall provide 
        any such subsequent elevation survey to the owner of such 
        property.
            (3) Determinations for properties on borders of special 
        flood hazard areas.--
                    (A) Expedited determination.--In the case of any 
                survey for a property submitted to the Administrator 
                pursuant to paragraph (1) showing that a portion of the 
                property is located within an area having special flood 
                hazards and that a structure located on the property is 
                not located within such area having special flood 
                hazards, the Administrator shall expeditiously process 
                any request made by an owner of the property for a 
                determination pursuant to paragraph (2) or a 
                determination of whether the structure is located 
                within the area having special flood hazards.
                    (B) Prohibition of fee.--If the Administrator 
                determines pursuant to subparagraph (A) that the 
                structure on the property is not located within the 
                area having special flood hazards, the Administrator 
                shall not charge a fee for reviewing the flood hazard 
                data and shall not require the owner to provide any 
                additional elevation data.
                    (C) Simplification of review process.--The 
                Administrator shall collaborate with private sector 
                flood insurers to simplify the review process for 
                properties described in subparagraph (A) and to ensure 
                that the review process provides for accurate 
                determinations.
            (4) Termination of authority.--This subsection shall cease 
        to apply to a property on the date on which the Administrator 
        updates the flood insurance rate map that applies to such 
        property in accordance with the requirements of subsection (d).

SEC. 348. TREATMENT OF LEVEES.

    Section 1360 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 
4101) is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:
    ``(k) Treatment of Levees.--The Administrator may not issue flood 
insurance maps, or make effective updated flood insurance maps, that 
omit or disregard the actual protection afforded by an existing levee, 
floodwall, pump or other flood protection feature, regardless of the 
accreditation status of such feature.''.

SEC. 349. PRIVATIZATION INITIATIVES.

    (a) FEMA and GAO Reports.--Not later than the expiration of the 18-
month period beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act, the 
Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the 
Comptroller General of the United States shall each conduct a separate 
study to assess a broad range of options, methods, and strategies for 
privatizing the national flood insurance program and shall each submit 
a report to the Committee on Financial Services of the House of 
Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban 
Affairs of the Senate with recommendations for the best manner to 
accomplish such privatization.
    (b) Private Risk-Management Initiatives.--
            (1) Authority.--The Administrator of the Federal Emergency 
        Management Agency may carry out such private risk-management 
        initiatives under the national flood insurance program as the 
        Administrator considers appropriate to determine the capacity 
        of private insurers, reinsurers, and financial markets to 
        assist communities, on a voluntary basis only, in managing the 
        full range of financial risks associated with flooding.
            (2) Assessment.--Not later than the expiration of the 12-
        month period beginning on the date of the enactment of this 
        Act, the Administrator shall assess the capacity of the private 
        reinsurance, capital, and financial markets by seeking 
        proposals to assume a portion of the program's insurance risk 
        and submit to the Congress a report describing the response to 
        such request for proposals and the results of such assessment.
            (3) Protocol for release of data.--The Administrator shall 
        develop a protocol to provide for the release of data 
        sufficient to conduct the assessment required under paragraph 
        (2).
    (c) Reinsurance.--The National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 is 
amended--
            (1) in section 1331(a)(2) (42 U.S.C. 4051(a)(2)), by 
        inserting ``, including as reinsurance of insurance coverage 
        provided by the flood insurance program'' before ``, on such 
        terms'';
            (2) in section 1332(c)(2) (42 U.S.C. 4052(c)(2)), by 
        inserting ``or reinsurance'' after ``flood insurance 
        coverage'';
            (3) in section 1335(a) (42 U.S.C. 4055(a))--
                    (A) by inserting ``(1)'' after ``(a)''; and
                    (B) by adding at the end the following new 
                paragraph:
    ``(2) The Administrator is authorized to secure reinsurance 
coverage of coverage provided by the flood insurance program from 
private market insurance, reinsurance, and capital market sources at 
rates and on terms determined by the Administrator to be reasonable and 
appropriate in an amount sufficient to maintain the ability of the 
program to pay claims and that minimizes the likelihood that the 
program will utilize the borrowing authority provided under section 
1309.'';
            (4) in section 1346(a) (12 U.S.C. 4082(a))--
                    (A) in the matter preceding paragraph (1), by 
                inserting ``, or for purposes of securing reinsurance 
                of insurance coverage provided by the program,'' before 
                ``of any or all of'';
                    (B) in paragraph (1)--
                            (i) by striking ``estimating'' and 
                        inserting ``Estimating''; and

                        ``Receiving''; and
                            (ii) by striking the semicolon at the end 
                        and inserting a period;

                  TITLE IV--COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY

SEC. 401. SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``Help Efficient, Accessible, Low-
cost, Timely Healthcare (HEALTH) Act of 2011''.

SEC. 402. ENCOURAGING SPEEDY RESOLUTION OF CLAIMS.

    The time for the commencement of a health care lawsuit shall be 3 
years after the date of manifestation of injury or 1 year after the 
claimant discovers, or through the use of reasonable diligence should 
have discovered, the injury, whichever occurs first. In no event shall 
the time for commencement of a health care lawsuit exceed 3 years after 
the date of manifestation of injury unless tolled for any of the 
following--
            (1) upon proof of fraud;
            (2) intentional concealment; or
            (3) the presence of a foreign body, which has no 
        therapeutic or diagnostic purpose or effect, in the person of 
        the injured person.
Actions by a minor shall be commenced within 3 years from the date of 
the alleged manifestation of injury except that actions by a minor 
under the full age of 6 years shall be commenced within 3 years of 
manifestation of injury or prior to the minor's 8th birthday, whichever 
provides a longer period. Such time limitation shall be tolled for 
minors for any period during which a parent or guardian and a health 
care provider or health care organization have committed fraud or 
collusion in the failure to bring an action on behalf of the injured 
minor.

SEC. 403. COMPENSATING PATIENT INJURY.

    (a) Unlimited Amount of Damages for Actual Economic Losses in 
Health Care Lawsuits.--In any health care lawsuit, nothing in this 
title shall limit a claimant's recovery of the full amount of the 
available economic damages, notwithstanding the limitation in 
subsection (b).
    (b) Additional Noneconomic Damages.--In any health care lawsuit, 
the amount of noneconomic damages, if available, may be as much as 
$250,000, regardless of the number of parties against whom the action 
is brought or the number of separate claims or actions brought with 
respect to the same injury.
    (c) No Discount of Award for Noneconomic Damages.--For purposes of 
applying the limitation in subsection (b), future noneconomic damages 
shall not be discounted to present value. The jury shall not be 
informed about the maximum award for noneconomic damages. An award for 
noneconomic damages in excess of $250,000 shall be reduced either 
before the entry of judgment, or by amendment of the judgment after 
entry of judgment, and such reduction shall be made before accounting 
for any other reduction in damages required by law. If separate awards 
are rendered for past and future noneconomic damages and the combined 
awards exceed $250,000, the future noneconomic damages shall be reduced 
first.
    (d) Fair Share Rule.--In any health care lawsuit, each party shall 
be liable for that party's several share of any damages only and not 
for the share of any other person. Each party shall be liable only for 
the amount of damages allocated to such party in direct proportion to 
such party's percentage of responsibility. Whenever a judgment of 
liability is rendered as to any party, a separate judgment shall be 
rendered against each such party for the amount allocated to such 
party. For purposes of this section, the trier of fact shall determine 
the proportion of responsibility of each party for the claimant's harm.

SEC. 404. MAXIMIZING PATIENT RECOVERY.

    (a) Court Supervision of Share of Damages Actually Paid to 
Claimants.--In any health care lawsuit, the court shall supervise the 
arrangements for payment of damages to protect against conflicts of 
interest that may have the effect of reducing the amount of damages 
awarded that are actually paid to claimants. In particular, in any 
health care lawsuit in which the attorney for a party claims a 
financial stake in the outcome by virtue of a contingent fee, the court 
shall have the power to restrict the payment of a claimant's damage 
recovery to such attorney, and to redirect such damages to the claimant 
based upon the interests of justice and principles of equity. In no 
event shall the total of all contingent fees for representing all 
claimants in a health care lawsuit exceed the following limits:
            (1) Forty percent of the first $50,000 recovered by the 
        claimant(s).
            (2) Thirty-three and one-third percent of the next $50,000 
        recovered by the claimant(s).
            (3) Twenty-five percent of the next $500,000 recovered by 
        the claimant(s).
            (4) Fifteen percent of any amount by which the recovery by 
        the claimant(s) is in excess of $600,000.
    (b) Applicability.--The limitations in this section shall apply 
whether the recovery is by judgment, settlement, mediation, 
arbitration, or any other form of alternative dispute resolution. In a 
health care lawsuit involving a minor or incompetent person, a court 
retains the authority to authorize or approve a fee that is less than 
the maximum permitted under this section. The requirement for court 
supervision in the first two sentences of subsection (a) applies only 
in civil actions.

SEC. 405. PUNITIVE DAMAGES.

    (a) In General.--Punitive damages may, if otherwise permitted by 
applicable State or Federal law, be awarded against any person in a 
health care lawsuit only if it is proven by clear and convincing 
evidence that such person acted with malicious intent to injure the 
claimant, or that such person deliberately failed to avoid unnecessary 
injury that such person knew the claimant was substantially certain to 
suffer. In any health care lawsuit where no judgment for compensatory 
damages is rendered against such person, no punitive damages may be 
awarded with respect to the claim in such lawsuit. No demand for 
punitive damages shall be included in a health care lawsuit as 
initially filed. A court may allow a claimant to file an amended 
pleading for punitive damages only upon a motion by the claimant and 
after a finding by the court, upon review of supporting and opposing 
affidavits or after a hearing, after weighing the evidence, that the 
claimant has established by a substantial probability that the claimant 
will prevail on the claim for punitive damages. At the request of any 
party in a health care lawsuit, the trier of fact shall consider in a 
separate proceeding--
            (1) whether punitive damages are to be awarded and the 
        amount of such award; and
            (2) the amount of punitive damages following a 
        determination of punitive liability.
If a separate proceeding is requested, evidence relevant only to the 
claim for punitive damages, as determined by applicable State law, 
shall be inadmissible in any proceeding to determine whether 
compensatory damages are to be awarded.
    (b) Determining Amount of Punitive Damages.--
            (1) Factors considered.--In determining the amount of 
        punitive damages, if awarded, in a health care lawsuit, the 
        trier of fact shall consider only the following--
                    (A) the severity of the harm caused by the conduct 
                of such party;
                    (B) the duration of the conduct or any concealment 
                of it by such party;
                    (C) the profitability of the conduct to such party;
                    (D) the number of products sold or medical 
                procedures rendered for compensation, as the case may 
                be, by such party, of the kind causing the harm 
                complained of by the claimant;
                    (E) any criminal penalties imposed on such party, 
                as a result of the conduct complained of by the 
                claimant; and
                    (F) the amount of any civil fines assessed against 
                such party as a result of the conduct complained of by 
                the claimant.
            (2) Maximum award.--The amount of punitive damages, if 
        awarded, in a health care lawsuit may be as much as $250,000 or 
        as much as two times the amount of economic damages awarded, 
        whichever is greater. The jury shall not be informed of this 
        limitation.
    (c) No Punitive Damages for Products That Comply With FDA 
Standards.--
            (1) In general.--
                    (A) No punitive damages may be awarded against the 
                manufacturer or distributor of a medical product, or a 
                supplier of any component or raw material of such 
                medical product, based on a claim that such product 
                caused the claimant's harm where--
                            (i)(I) such medical product was subject to 
                        premarket approval, clearance, or licensure by 
                        the Food and Drug Administration with respect 
                        to the safety of the formulation or performance 
                        of the aspect of such medical product which 
                        caused the claimant's harm or the adequacy of 
                        the packaging or labeling of such medical 
                        product; and
                            (II) such medical product was so approved, 
                        cleared, or licensed; or
                            (ii) such medical product is generally 
                        recognized among qualified experts as safe and 
                        effective pursuant to conditions established by 
                        the Food and Drug Administration and applicable 
                        Food and Drug Administration regulations, 
                        including without limitation those related to 
                        packaging and labeling, unless the Food and 
                        Drug Administration has determined that such 
                        medical product was not manufactured or 
                        distributed in substantial compliance with 
                        applicable Food and Drug Administration 
                        statutes and regulations.
                    (B) Rule of construction.--Subparagraph (A) may not 
                be construed as establishing the obligation of the Food 
                and Drug Administration to demonstrate affirmatively 
                that a manufacturer, distributor, or supplier referred 
                to in such subparagraph meets any of the conditions 
                described in such subparagraph.
            (2) Liability of health care providers.--A health care 
        provider who prescribes, or who dispenses pursuant to a 
        prescription, a medical product approved, licensed, or cleared 
        by the Food and Drug Administration shall not be named as a 
        party to a product liability lawsuit involving such product and 
        shall not be liable to a claimant in a class action lawsuit 
        against the manufacturer, distributor, or seller of such 
        product. Nothing in this paragraph prevents a court from 
        consolidating cases involving health care providers and cases 
        involving products liability claims against the manufacturer, 
        distributor, or product seller of such medical product.
            (3) Packaging.--In a health care lawsuit for harm which is 
        alleged to relate to the adequacy of the packaging or labeling 
        of a drug which is required to have tamper-resistant packaging 
        under regulations of the Secretary of Health and Human Services 
        (including labeling regulations related to such packaging), the 
        manufacturer or product seller of the drug shall not be held 
        liable for punitive damages unless such packaging or labeling 
        is found by the trier of fact by clear and convincing evidence 
        to be substantially out of compliance with such regulations.
            (4) Exception.--Paragraph (1) shall not apply in any health 
        care lawsuit in which--
                    (A) a person, before or after premarket approval, 
                clearance, or licensure of such medical product, 
                knowingly misrepresented to or withheld from the Food 
                and Drug Administration information that is required to 
                be submitted under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic 
                Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.) or section 351 of the 
                Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262) that is 
                material and is causally related to the harm which the 
                claimant allegedly suffered
                    (B) a person made an illegal payment to an official 
                of the Food and Drug Administration for the purpose of 
                either securing or maintaining approval, clearance, or 
                licensure of such medical product; or
                    (C) the defendant caused the medical product which 
                caused the claimant's harm to be misbranded or 
                adulterated (as such terms are used in chapter V of the 
                Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 351 et 
                seq.)).

SEC. 406. AUTHORIZATION OF PAYMENT OF FUTURE DAMAGES TO CLAIMANTS IN 
              HEALTH CARE LAWSUITS.

    (a) In General.--In any health care lawsuit, if an award of future 
damages, without reduction to present value, equaling or exceeding 
$50,000 is made against a party with sufficient insurance or other 
assets to fund a periodic payment of such a judgment, the court shall, 
at the request of any party, enter a judgment ordering that the future 
damages be paid by periodic payments, in accordance with the Uniform 
Periodic Payment of Judgments Act promulgated by the National 
Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws.

SEC. 408. EFFECT ON OTHER LAWS.

    (a) Vaccine Injury.--
            (1) To the extent that title XXI of the Public Health 
        Service Act establishes a Federal rule of law applicable to a 
        civil action brought for a vaccine-related injury or death--
                    (A) this title does not affect the application of 
                the rule of law to such an action; and
                    (B) any rule of law prescribed by this title in 
                conflict with a rule of law of such title XXI shall not 
                apply to such action.
            (2) If there is an aspect of a civil action brought for a 
        vaccine-related injury or death to which a Federal rule of law 
        under title XXI of the Public Health Service Act does not 
        apply, then this title or otherwise applicable law (as 
        determined under this title) will apply to such aspect of such 
        action.
    (b) Other Federal Law.--Except as provided in this section, nothing 
in this title shall be deemed to affect any defense available to a

SEC. 409. STATE FLEXIBILITY AND PROTECTION OF STATES' RIGHTS.

    (a) Health Care Lawsuits.--The provisions governing health care 
lawsuits set forth in this title preempt, subject to subsections (b) 
and (c), State law to the extent that State law prevents the 
application of any provisions of law established by or under this 
title. The provisions governing health care lawsuits set forth in this 
title supersede chapter 171 of title 28, United States Code, to the 
extent that such chapter--
            (1) provides for a greater amount of damages or contingent 
        fees, a longer period in which a health care lawsuit may be 
        commenced, or a reduced applicability or scope of periodic 
        payment of future damages, than provided in this title; or
            (2) prohibits the introduction of evidence regarding 
        collateral source benefits, or mandates or permits subrogation 
        or a lien on collateral source benefits.
    (b) Protection of States' Rights and Other Laws.--(1) Any issue 
that is not governed by any provision of law established by or under 
this title (including State standards of negligence) shall be governed 
by otherwise applicable State or Federal law.
    (2) This title shall not preempt or supersede any State or Federal 
law that imposes greater procedural or substantive protections for 
health care providers and health care organizations from liability, 
loss, or damages than those provided by this title or create a cause of 
action.
    (c) State Flexibility.--No provision of this title shall be 
construed to preempt--
            (1) any State law (whether effective before, on, or after 
        the date of the enactment of this Act) that specifies a 
        particular monetary amount of compensatory or punitive damages 
        (or the total amount of damages) that may be awarded in a 
        health care lawsuit, regardless of whether such monetary amount 
        is greater or lesser than is provided for under this title, 
        notwithstanding section 303(a); or
            (2) any defense available to a party in a health care 
        lawsuit under any other provision of State or Federal law.

SEC. 410. APPLICABILITY; EFFECTIVE DATE.

    This title shall apply to any health care lawsuit brought in a 
Federal or State court, or subject to an alternative dispute resolution 
system, that is initiated on or after the date of the enactment of this 
Act, except that any health care lawsuit arising from an injury 
occurring prior to the date of the enactment of this Act shall be 
governed by the applicable statute of limitations provisions in effect 
at the time the injury occurred.
