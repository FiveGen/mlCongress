Whereas All-American junior Brittney Griner led the Lady Bears to victory with 
        26 points, 13 rebounds, and 5 blocks in a dominating performance over 
        the University of Notre Dame and finished the 2011-2012 season with more 
        than 920 points;
Whereas the members of the Lady Bears basketball team should all be commended 
        for their teamwork, dedication, and athletic prowess;
Whereas Baylor University as 2011-2012 women's basketball national champions,

University on winning the 2012 National Collegiate Athletic Association 
Division I Women's Basketball Championship and completing the 2011-2012
