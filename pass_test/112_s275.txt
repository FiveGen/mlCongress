        construction in connection with a project described in 
        paragraph (1)(B).''.

SEC. 19. SPECIAL PERMITS.

    Section 60118(c)(1) is amended to read as follows:
            ``(1) Issuance of waivers.--
                    ``(A) In general.--On application of an owner or 
                operator of a pipeline facility, the Secretary by order 
                may waive compliance with any part of an applicable 
                standard prescribed under this chapter with respect to 
                the facility on terms the Secretary considers 
                appropriate, if the Secretary determines that the 
                waiver is not inconsistent with pipeline safety.
                    ``(B) Considerations.--In determining whether to 
                grant a waiver, the Secretary shall consider--
                            ``(i) the fitness of the applicant to 
                        conduct the activity authorized by the waiver 
                        in a manner that is consistent with pipeline 
                        safety;
                            ``(ii) the applicant's compliance history;
                            ``(iii) the applicant's accident history; 
                        and

                        Secretary considers relevant to making the 
                        determination.
                    ``(C) Effective period.--A waiver of one or more 
                pipeline operating requirements shall be reviewed by 
                the Secretary 5 years after its effective date. In 
                reviewing a waiver, the Secretary shall consider any 
                change in ownership or control of the pipeline, any 
                change in the conditions around the pipeline, and other 
                factors as appropriate. The Secretary may modify, 
                suspend, or revoke a waiver after such review under 
                subparagraph (E).
                    ``(D) Public notice and hearing.--The Secretary may 
                act on a waiver under this section only after public 
                notice and an opportunity for a hearing, which may 
                consist of publication of notice in the Federal 
                Register that an application for a waiver has been 
                filed and providing the public with the opportunity to 
                review and comment on the application. If a waiver is 
                granted, the Secretary shall state in the order and 
                associated analysis the reasons for granting it.
                    ``(E) Noncompliance and modification, suspension, 
                or revocation.--After notice to a holder of a waiver 
                and opportunity to show cause, the Secretary may 
                modify, suspend, or revoke a waiver issued under this 
                section for failure to comply with its terms or 
                conditions, intervening changes in Federal law, a 
                material change in circumstances affecting safety, 
                including erroneous information in the application, or 
                any other reason. If necessary to avoid a significant 
                risk of harm to persons, property, or the environment, 
                the Secretary may waive the show cause procedure and 
                make the action immediately effective.''.

SEC. 20. BIOFUEL PIPELINES.

    Section 60101(a)(4) is amended--
            (1) by striking ``and'' after the semicolon in subparagraph 
        (A);
            (2) by redesignating subparagraph (B) as subparagraph (C); 
        and
            (3) by inserting after subparagraph (A) the following:
                    ``(B) non-petroleum fuels, including biofuels that 
                are flammable, toxic, or corrosive or would be harmful 
                to the environment if released in significant

    Not later than 18 months after the date of enactment of this Act, 
the Secretary of Transportation shall complete a comprehensive review 
of hazardous liquid pipeline regulations to determine whether these 
regulations are sufficient to regulate pipelines used for the 
transportation of tar sands crude oil. In conducting this review, the 
Secretary shall conduct an analysis of whether any increase in risk of 
release exists for pipelines transporting tar sands crude oil. The 
Secretary shall report the results of this review to the Committee on 
Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committees 
on Transportation and Infrastructure and on Energy and Commerce of the

              PIPELINE.

    The Secretary of Transportation may conduct an analysis of the 
transportation of non-petroleum hazardous liquids by pipeline for the 
purpose of identifying the extent to which pipelines are currently 
being used to transport non-petroleum hazardous liquids, such as 
chlorine, from chemical production facilities across land areas not 
owned by the producer that are accessible to the public. The analysis 
should identify the extent to which the safety of the lines is 
unregulated by the States and evaluate whether the transportation of 
such chemicals by pipeline across areas accessible to the public would 
present significant risks to public safety, property, or the 
environment in the absence of regulation. The results of the analysis 
shall be made available to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and 
Transportation of the Senate and the Committees on Transportation and 
Infrastructure and on Energy and Commerce of the House of

SEC. 26. MAINTENANCE OF EFFORT.

    Section 60107(b) is amended to read as follows:
    ``(b) Payments.--After notifying and consulting with a State 
authority, the Secretary may withhold any part of a payment when the 
Secretary decides that the authority is not carrying out satisfactorily 
a safety program or not acting satisfactorily as an agent. The 
Secretary may pay an authority under this section only when the 
authority ensures the Secretary that it will provide the remaining 
costs of a safety program and that the total State amount spent for a 
safety program (excluding grants of the United States Government) will 
at least equal the average amount spent for gas and hazardous liquid 
safety programs for fiscal years 2004 through 2006, except when the 
Secretary waives the requirements of this subsection. The Secretary 
shall grant such a waiver if a State can demonstrate an inability to 
maintain or increase the required funding share of its pipeline safety 
program at or above the level required by this subsection due to 
economic hardship in that State.''.

SEC. 27. MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE OPERATING PRESSURE.

    (a) Establishment of Records.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 6 months after the date of 
        enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Transportation shall 
        require pipeline operators to conduct a verification of records 
        for all interstate and intrastate gas transmission lines in 
        class 3 and class 4 locations and class 1 and class 2 high 
        consequence areas that accurately reflect the pipeline's 
        physical and operational characteristics and confirm the 
        established maximum allowable operating pressure of those 
        pipelines.
            (2) Elements.--Verification of each record under paragraph 
        (1) shall include such elements as the Secretary considers 
        appropriate.
    (b) Reporting.--
            (1) Documentation of certain pipelines.--Not later than 18 
        months after the date of enactment of this Act, pipeline 
        operators shall submit to the Secretary documentation of all 
        interstate and intrastate gas transmission pipelines in class 3 
        and class 4 locations and class 1 and class 2 high consequence 
        areas where the records required under subsection (a) are not 
        sufficient to confirm the established maximum allowable 
        operating pressure of those pipeline segments.
            (2) Exceedances of maximum allowable operating pressure.--
        All pipeline operators shall report any exceedance of the 
        maximum allowable operating pressure for gas transmission 
        pipelines that exceed the build-up allowed for operation of 
        pressure-limiting or control devices to the Secretary not later 
        than 5 working days after the exceedance occurs. Notice of 
        exceedance by gas transmission pipelines shall be provided 
        concurrently to appropriate State authorities.

        transmission line to reconfirm a maximum allowable operational 
        pressure as expeditiously as economically feasible.
            (2) Interim actions.--For cases described in paragraph (1), 
        the Secretary will determine what actions are appropriate for a 
        pipeline operator to take to maintain safety until a maximum 
        allowable operating pressure is confirmed. In determining what 
        actions an operator should take, the Secretary shall take into 
        account consequences to public safety and the environment, 
        impacts on pipeline system reliability and deliverability, and 
        other factors, as appropriate.
    (d) Testing Regulations.--The Secretary shall, not later than 18 
months after the date of the enactment of this Act, prescribe 
regulations for conducting tests to confirm the material strength of 
previously untested natural gas transmission pipelines located in areas 
identified pursuant to section 60109(a) of title 49, United States 
Code, and operating at a pressure greater than 30 percent of specified 
minimum yield strength. The Secretary shall consider safety testing 
methodologies including, at a minimum, pressure testing or other 
alternative methods, including in-line inspections, determined by the 
Secretary to be of equal or greater effectiveness. The Secretary, in 
consultation with the Chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission and State regulators, as appropriate, shall establish 
timeframes for the completion of such testing that take into account 
consequences to public safety and the environment and that minimize 
costs and service disruptions.
