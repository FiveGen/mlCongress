                               RESOLUTION


 
 To authorize testimony, document production, and legal representation 
           in United States v. Richard F. ``Dickie'' Scruggs.

Whereas, in the case of United States v. Richard F. ``Dickie'' Scruggs, Case No. 
        3:09-CR-00002-GHD-SAA, pending in the United States District Court for 
        the Northern District of Mississippi, the defense has served a subpoena 
        for testimony on Hugh Gamble, a former employee of Senator Trent Lott, 
        and a subpoena for testimony and document production on Brad Davis, an 
        employee of Senator Thad Cochran;
Whereas, pursuant to sections 703(a) and 704(a)(2) of the Ethics in Government 
        Act of 1978, 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec.  288b(a) and 288c(a)(2), the Senate may 
        direct its counsel to represent employees of the Senate with respect to 
        any subpoena, order, or request for testimony relating to their official 
        responsibilities;
Whereas, by the privileges of the Senate of the United States and Rule XI of the 
        Standing Rules of the Senate, no evidence under the control or in the 
        possession of the Senate may, by the judicial or administrative process, 
        be taken from such control or possession but by permission of the 
        Senate;
Whereas, when it appears that evidence under the control or in the possession of 
        the Senate may promote the administration of justice, the Senate will 
        take such action as will promote the ends of justice consistent with the 
        privileges of the Senate: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That Hugh Gamble, Brad Davis, and any other employee from 
whom testimony may be necessary are authorized to testify, and Brad 
Davis is authorized to produce documents, in the case of United States 
v. Richard F. ``Dickie'' Scruggs, except concerning matters for which a 
privilege should be asserted.
    Sec. 2.  The Senate Legal Counsel is authorized to represent Hugh 
Gamble, Brad Davis, and any other employee of the Senate from whom 
evidence may be sought, in connection with the testimony and document 
production authorized in section one of this resolution.
                                 <all>
