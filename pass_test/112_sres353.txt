                               RESOLUTION


 
  Congratulating the North Dakota State University football team for 
 winning the 2011 National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I 
                Football Championship Subdivision title.

Whereas the North Dakota State University (referred to in this preamble as 
        ``NDSU'') Bison won the 2011 National Collegiate Athletic Association 
        Division I Football Championship Subdivision title game in Frisco, 
        Texas, on January 7, 2012, in a hard fought victory over the Sam Houston 
        State University Bearkats by a score of 17 to 6;
Whereas the NDSU Bison and coach Craig Bohl had an incredible 2011 season with a 
        record of 14 wins and 1 defeat;
Whereas the Bison had a season full of highlights, including a 37 to 24 win over 
        the University of Minnesota Gophers on September 24, 2011;
Whereas, during the championship game, the NDSU Bison offense scored 17 points 
        against the Sam Houston State Bearkats, led by key plays from 
        quarterback Brock Jensen, running back D.J. McNorton, and punter Matt 
        Voigtlander;
Whereas the stifling Bison defense shut down the Bearkats, limiting the Bearkats 
        to just 2 field goals;
Whereas Bison linebacker Travis Beck, the Most Outstanding Player of the game, 
        secured a momentum-changing interception in the final minutes of the 
        game to preserve the win for the Bison;
Whereas the Bison, who were previously a dominant force in the National 
        Collegiate Athletic Association Division II, have continued to strive 
        for excellence since moving up a division in 2004 and have proven they 
        are able to compete and win in Division I;
Whereas Coach Bohl and his staff have instilled character and confidence in the 
        NDSU players and have done an outstanding job with the Bison football 
        program;
Whereas the leadership of President Dean Bresciani and Athletic Director Gene 
        Taylor has helped bring both academic and athletic excellence to NDSU;
Whereas the 2011 National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I Football 
        Championship Subdivision title was a victory not only for the NDSU 
        football team, but also for the entire State of North Dakota: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) congratulates the North Dakota State University 
        football team, the 2011 National Collegiate Athletic 
        Association Division I Football Championship Subdivision 
        champions;
            (2) commends the North Dakota State University players, 
        coaches, and staff for their hard work and dedication; and
            (3) recognizes the students, alumni, and loyal fans for 
        supporting the Bison on their successful quest to capture the 
        first Division I trophy for North Dakota State University.
                                 <all>
