                           September 13, 2011

  Mr. Nelson of Nebraska (for himself and Ms. Collins) submitted the 
        following resolution; which was considered and agreed to

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
Designating the week beginning September 11, 2011, as ``National Direct 
               Support Professionals Recognition Week''.

Whereas direct support professionals, direct care workers, personal assistants, 
        personal attendants, in-home support workers, and paraprofessionals 
        (referred to in this preamble as ``direct support professionals'') are 
        the primary providers of publicly-funded long term supports and services 
        for millions of individuals;
Whereas a direct support professional must build a close, trusted relationship 
        with an individual with disabilities;
Whereas a direct support professional assists an individual with disabilities 
        with the most intimate needs, on a daily basis;
Whereas direct support professionals provide a broad range of support, including 
        preparation of meals, helping with medications, bathing, dressing, 
        mobility, transportation to school, work, religious, and recreational 
        activities, and general daily affairs;
Whereas a direct support professional provides essential support to help keep an 
        individual with disabilities connected to such individual's family and 
        community;
Whereas direct support professionals enable individuals with disabilities to 
        live meaningful, productive lives;
Whereas direct support professionals are the key to allowing an individual with 
        disabilities to live successfully in such individual's community, and to 
        avoid more costly institutional care;
Whereas the majority of direct support professionals are female, and many are 
        the sole breadwinners of their families;
Whereas direct support professionals work and pay taxes, but many such 
        professionals remain impoverished and are eligible for the same Federal 
        and State public assistance programs on which the individuals with 
        disabilities served by such direct support professionals must depend;
Whereas Federal and State policies, as well as the Supreme Court, in Olmstead v. 
        L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999), assert the right of an individual to live in 
        the home and community of the individual;
Whereas, in 2011, the majority of direct support professionals are employed in 
        home and community-based settings and this trend is projected to 
        increase over the decade;
Whereas there is a documented critical and growing shortage of direct support 
        professionals in every community throughout the United States; and
Whereas many direct support professionals are forced to leave jobs due to 
        inadequate wages and benefits, creating high turnover and vacancy rates 
        that research demonstrates adversely affects the quality of supports to 
        individuals with disabilities: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates the week beginning September 11, 2011, as 
        ``National Direct Support Professionals Recognition Week'';
            (2) recognizes the dedication and vital role of direct 
        support professionals in enhancing the lives of individuals 
        with disabilities of all ages;
            (3) appreciates the contribution of direct support 
        professionals in supporting the needs that reach beyond the 
        capacities of millions of families in the United States;
            (4) commends direct support professionals as integral in 
        supporting the long-term support and services system of the 
        United States; and
            (5) finds that the successful implementation of the public 
        policies of the United States depends on the dedication of 
        direct support professionals.
