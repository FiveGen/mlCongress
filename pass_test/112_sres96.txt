                               RESOLUTION


 
     Congratulating the Army Dental Corps on its 100th anniversary.

Whereas, on March 3, 1911, Congress was the first to officially recognize 
        dentistry as a distinct profession by establishing an Army Dental 
        Service with commissioned officers, a seminal event for dentistry as 
        well as for military history;
Whereas dental health is a critical component of military medical readiness;
Whereas, throughout history, the Army Dental Corps has preserved the strength of 
        the Army by minimizing risk for and expediting treatment of dental 
        emergencies;
Whereas the Army Dental Corps works continuously to improve the oral health of 
        soldiers and their families by supporting individual and community 
        prevention initiatives, good oral hygiene practices, and evidence-based 
        treatment;
Whereas the Army Dental Corps endeavors to improve oral health world-wide by 
        participating in the full spectrum of military and peacekeeping 
        operations, serving as dental ambassadors through care rendered to 
        United States and coalition military personnel during combat operations, 
        and local national citizens in humanitarian operations;
Whereas the Army Dental Corps, in collaboration with national and international 
        dental organizations, promotes synergy among all dental professionals;
Whereas the Army Dental Corps supports the mission of the Federal dental 
        research program, and endorses improved dental technologies and 
        therapies through research and adherence to sound scientific principles; 
        and
Whereas the Army Dental Corps recognizes the importance of lifelong pursuit of 
        continuing dental education, and executes this mission through specialty 
        dental education and postgraduate residencies and fellowships for its 
        members: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) congratulates the Army Dental Corps on its 100th 
        anniversary;
            (2) commends the Army Dental Corps for its work to improve 
        the dental readiness of the Army, and the oral health of 
        soldiers and their families;
            (3) recognizes the thousands of dentists who have served in 
        the Army Dental Corps over the last 100 years, providing dental 
        care to millions of members of the Armed Forces and their 
        families; and
            (4) commends the Army Dental Corps for its efforts to keep 
        America's soldiers healthy and the best fighting force in the 
        world.
                                 <all>
