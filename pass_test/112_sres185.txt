    Reaffirming the commitment of the United States to a negotiated 
 settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through direct Israeli-
 Palestinian negotiations, reaffirming opposition to the inclusion of 
 Hamas in a unity government unless it is willing to accept peace with 
Israel and renounce violence, and declaring that Palestinian efforts to 
 gain recognition of a state outside direct negotiations demonstrates 
absence of a good faith commitment to peace negotiations, and will have

                               RESOLUTION


 
    Reaffirming the commitment of the United States to a negotiated 
 settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through direct Israeli-
 Palestinian negotiations, reaffirming opposition to the inclusion of 
 Hamas in a unity government unless it is willing to accept peace with 
Israel and renounce violence, and declaring that Palestinian efforts to 
 gain recognition of a state outside direct negotiations demonstrates 
absence of a good faith commitment to peace negotiations, and will have 
             implications for continued United States aid.

Whereas the policy of the United States since 2002 has been to support a two-
        state solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict;
Whereas a true and lasting peace between the people of Israel and the 
        Palestinians can only be achieved through direct negotiations between 
        the parties;
Whereas Palestine Liberation Organization Chair Yassir Arafat wrote to Israeli 
        Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin on September 9, 1993, that ``all 
        outstanding issues relating to permanent status will be resolved through 
        negotiations'';
Whereas the reconciliation agreement signed by Fatah and Hamas on May 4, 2011, 
        was reached without Hamas being required to renounce violence, accept 
        Israel's right to exist, and accept prior agreements made by the 
        Palestinians (the ``Quartet conditions'');
Whereas Hamas, an organization responsible for the death of more than 500 
        innocent civilians, including two dozen United States citizens, has been 
        designated by the United States Government as a foreign terrorist 
        organization and a specially designated terrorist organization;
Whereas Hamas kidnapped and has held captive Israeli sergeant Gilad Shalit in 
        violation of international norms since June 25, 2006;
Whereas Hamas continues to forcefully reject the possibility of negotiations or 
        peace with Israel;
Whereas, by contrast, Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu has accepted a 
        two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict;
Whereas, on April 22, 2009, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stated, ``We will 
        not deal with nor in any way fund a Palestinian government that includes 
        Hamas unless and until Hamas has renounced violence, recognized Israel 
        and agreed to follow the previous obligations of the Palestinian 
        Authority.'';
Whereas the United States, under two different Presidents, has vetoed 11 United 
        Nations Security Council resolutions in the last 15 years related to the 
        Palestinian-Israeli conflict and its outstanding issues;
Whereas United States Permanent Representative to the United Nations Susan Rice 
        stated on February 18, 2011, that it was ``unwise'' for the United 
        Nations to attempt to resolve key issues between the Israelis and 
        Palestinians;
Whereas Palestinian leaders are pursuing a coordinated strategy to seek 
        recognition of a Palestinian state within the United Nations, in other 
        international forums, and from foreign governments;
Whereas, on March 11, 1999, the Senate adopted Senate Concurrent Resolution 5 
        (106th Congress), and on March 16, 1999, the House of Representatives 
        adopted House Concurrent Resolution 24 (106th Congress), both of which 
        resolved that ``any attempt to establish Palestinian statehood outside 
        the negotiating process will invoke the strongest congressional 
        opposition'';
Whereas current United States law precludes assistance to a Palestinian 
        Authority that shares power with Hamas unless that Authority publicly 
        accepts the right of Israel to exist and adheres to all prior agreements 
        and understandings with the Governments of the United States and Israel;
Whereas the United States Government provides more than $550,000,000 annually 
        and more than $3,500,000,000 cumulatively in direct bilateral assistance 
        to the Palestinians, who are among the world's largest recipients of 
        foreign aid per capita;
Whereas aid to the Palestinians is predicated on a good faith commitment from 
        the Palestinians to the peace process;
Whereas abandonment by Palestinian leaders of the Quartet conditions and 
        inclusion of Hamas in a government could jeopardize the positive steps 
        the Palestinian Authority has taken in building institutions and 
        improving security in the West Bank in recent years; and
Whereas efforts to form a unity government without accepting the Quartet 
        conditions, to bypass negotiations and unilaterally declare a 
        Palestinian state, or to appeal to the United Nations or other 
        international forums or to foreign governments for recognition of a 
        Palestinian state would violate the underlying principles of the Oslo 
        Accords, the Road Map, and other relevant Middle East peace process 
        efforts: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) reaffirms its strong support for a negotiated solution 
        to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict resulting in two states, a 
        democratic, Jewish state of Israel and a viable, democratic 
        Palestinian state, living side-by-side in peace, security, and 
        mutual recognition;
            (2) states its firm belief that any Palestinian unity 
        government must publicly and formally forswear terrorism, 
        accept Israel's right to exist, and reaffirm previous 
        agreements made with the Government of Israel;
            (3) reiterates its strong opposition to any attempt to 
        establish or seek recognition of a Palestinian state outside of 
        an agreement negotiated between leaders in Israel and the 
        Palestinians;
            (4) urges Palestinian leaders--
                    (A) to ensure that any Palestinian government will 
                seek peace with Israel;
                    (B) to cease all efforts at circumventing the 
                negotiation process, including through a unilateral 
                declaration of statehood or quests for recognition of a 
                Palestinian state from other nations or the United 
                Nations;
                    (C) to resume direct negotiations with the 
                Government of Israel immediately and without 
                preconditions; and
                    (D) to take appropriate measures to counter 
                incitement to violence and fulfill all prior 
                Palestinian commitments, including dismantling the 
                terrorist infrastructure embodied in Hamas;
            (5) supports the opposition of the President to a 
        unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state and the veto by 
        the United States on February 18, 2011, of the most recent 
        United Nations Security Council resolution regarding a key 
        issue of the Israeli-Palestinian process;
            (6) calls upon the President to announce that the United 
        States will veto any resolution on Palestinian statehood that 
        comes before the United Nations Security Council which is not a 
        result of agreements reached between the Government of Israel 
        and the Palestinians;
            (7) calls upon the President to lead a diplomatic effort to 
        oppose a unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state and to 
        oppose recognition of a Palestinian state by other nations, 
        within the United Nations, and in other international forums 
        prior to achievement of a final agreement between the 
        Government of Israel and the Palestinians;
            (8) will consider restrictions on aid to the Palestinian 
        Authority should it persist in efforts to circumvent direct 
        negotiations by turning to the United Nations or other 
        international bodies;
            (9) supports the position taken by Secretary of State 
        Hillary Clinton on April 22, 2009, that the United States 
        ``will not deal with or in any way fund a Palestinian 
        government that includes Hamas unless and until Hamas has 
        renounced violence, recognized Israel and agreed to follow the 
        previous obligations of the Palestinian Authority'';
            (10) urges the President to consider suspending assistance 
        to the Palestinian Authority pending a review of the unity 
        agreement between Fatah and Hamas; and
            (11) reaffirms the requirement under United States law 
        precluding assistance to a Palestinian Authority that shares 
        power with Hamas unless that Authority and all its ministers 
        publicly accept the right of Israel to exist and all prior 
        agreements and understandings with the Governments of the 
        United States and Israel.
                                 <all>
