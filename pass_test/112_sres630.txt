                               RESOLUTION


 
Congratulating the Navy and the current and former officers and crew of 
  the U.S.S. Enterprise (CVN 65) on completion of the 26th and final 
                       deployment of the vessel.

Whereas, on November 4, 2012, the U.S.S. Enterprise returned to her homeport of 
        Norfolk, Virginia, after completing the 26th and final deployment of the 
        vessel;
Whereas the U.S.S. Enterprise, the first nuclear powered aircraft carrier to 
        serve the United States, was inactivated on December 1, 2012, after more 
        than 51 years in active service to the Navy and the Nation;
Whereas the U.S.S. Enterprise is the 8th vessel to bear that name and justly and 
        rightfully maintained the honor and tradition of those vessels that 
        previously bore the name;
Whereas the U.S.S. Enterprise participated in the embargo of the island of Cuba 
        ordered by President John Kennedy in the fall of 1962, helping to 
        prevent an escalation of that crisis;
Whereas the U.S.S. Enterprise conducted multiple deployments in support of 
        combat operations during the Vietnam War;
Whereas the U.S.S. Enterprise, upon receiving the news of the September 11, 
        2001, attacks on the United States while returning home from a six-month 
        deployment, immediately reversed course and was deployed in the Arabian 
        Sea;
Whereas the U.S.S. Enterprise launched hundreds of air strikes into Afghanistan 
        in support of Operation Enduring Freedom throughout October 2001 to 
        destroy Taliban and al Qaeda targets;
Whereas the U.S.S. Enterprise deployed six times over the last 11 years to 
        conduct combat operations in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and 
        Operation Enduring Freedom; and
Whereas the U.S.S. Enterprise and the 10 Nimitz-class aircraft carriers of the 
        Navy have proven the wisdom and value of nuclear powered aircraft 
        carriers, which have played crucial roles across the range of military 
        operations, from humanitarian assistance to combat operations, including 
        operations in Iraq and Afghanistan since the beginnings of hostilities, 
        providing, from the sea, unparalleled precision strike, close air 
        support, and surveillance in support of ground combat operations: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) congratulates the Navy and the many crews of the U.S.S. 
        Enterprise (CVN 65) on having provided the United States an 
        incalculable service in international relations and engagement 
        and in the prevention and winning of armed conflicts over the 
        51-year period of the service of the U.S.S. Enterprise;
            (2) honors the service and memory of the 117 Sailors who 
        made the ultimate sacrifice for their country while serving 
        onboard U.S.S. Enterprise, including the 30 that were killed in 
        action during the Vietnam War;
            (3) honors the service of the 22 U.S.S. Enterprise Sailors 
        who were held as Prisoners of War during the Vietnam War, the 3 
        who died in captivity, and the 3 that are still listed as 
        missing-in-action; and
            (4) congratulates the nearly 100,000 current and former 
        Sailors and thousands of current and former Marines who have 
        served on the U.S.S. Enterprise and thanks them for the 
        selfless sacrifice they made in service to the United States.
                                 <all>
