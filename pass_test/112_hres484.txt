H. Res. 484

                In the House of Representatives, U. S.,

                                                    September 11, 2012.
Whereas article 79, which penalizes ``carrying out activities aimed at 
        overthrowing the people's administration'', carries a maximum penalty of 
        death and is used by the Government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam 
        to crack down on citizens advocating for political pluralism or 
        associating with prodemocracy parties, including--

    (1) Le Cong Dinh, Tran Huynh Duy Thuc, Nguyen Tien Trung, Le Thang 
Long, and Tran Anh Kim arrested in 2009;

    (2) Cao Van Tinh, Duong Kim Khai, Nguyen Chi Thanh, Nguyen Thanh Tam, 
Pham Minh Hoang, Pham Ngoc Hoa, Pham Van Thong, and Tran Thi Thuy arrested 
in 2010; and

    (3) Dang Xuan Dieu, Ho Duc Hoa, Ho Van Oanh, Nguyen Dinh Cuong, Nguyen 
Van Duyet, Nguyen Van Oai, Nguyen Xuan Anh, Nong Hung Anh, Paulus Le Son, 
Thai Van Dung, and Tran Minh Nhat arrested during the summer of 2011;

Whereas article 88, which penalizes ``conducting propaganda against the State'', 
        carries a maximum sentence of 12 years imprisonment and is used by the 
        Government of Vietnam to detain writers and bloggers, including--

    (1) Father Nguyen Van Ly, Nguyen Phong, and Tran Quoc Hien arrested in 
2007;

    (2) Nguyen Van Hai (``Dieu Cay''), Nguyen Xuan Nghia, Pham Thanh 
Nghien, and Pham Van Troi arrested in 2008;

    (3) Cu Huy Ha Vu, Phan Thanh Hai, and Vi Duc Hoi arrested in 2010; and

    (4) Chu Manh Son, Dinh Dang Dinh, Dinh Van Nhuong, Do Van Hoa, Hoang 
Phong, Lu Van Bay, Nguyen Kim Nhan, Ta Phong Tan, Tran Huu Duc, and Viet 
Khang arrested in 2011;

Whereas Vietnam is a signatory to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and 
        the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; and
Whereas closer economic and security ties between the United States and Vietnam 
        are ultimately contingent on the Government of Vietnam's respect for 
        basic freedoms: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) condemns the continued and worsening crackdown in the Socialist 
        Republic of Vietnam against community organizers, bloggers, and 
        democracy activists;
            (2) calls on the Government of Vietnam to repeal articles 79 and 88 
        of the Vietnamese penal code and similar vague national security 
        measures used to persecute peaceful political opposition and dissent;
            (3) calls on the Government of Vietnam to release all political 
        prisoners, especially all activists, writers, and bloggers who have been 
        detained or sentenced under articles 79 and 88 of the Vietnamese penal 
        code; and
            (4) urges the United States Department of State to monitor rule of 
        law developments in Vietnam, to help ensure that Vietnamese laws are 
        administered in ways that are consistent with Vietnam's international 
        human rights commitments.
            Attest:

                                                                          Clerk.
