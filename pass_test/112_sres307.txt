                               RESOLUTION


 
   Honoring the men and women of the John C. Stennis Space Center on 
 reaching the historic milestone of 50 years of rocket engine testing.

Whereas, 50 years ago this month, on October 25, 1961, the National Aeronautics 
        and Space Administration (referred to in this preamble as ``NASA'') 
        publicly announced plans to establish a testing facility in Hancock 
        County, Mississippi, for the purpose of flight-certifying all first and 
        second stages of the Saturn V rocket for the Apollo lunar landing 
        program that would take humans to the Moon;
Whereas the testing facility was renamed the John C. Stennis Space Center 
        (referred to in this preamble as the ``Stennis Space Center'') in 1988 
        in honor of United States Senator John C. Stennis of Mississippi;
Whereas the Stennis Space Center conducted 45 engine tests for the Apollo 
        program;
Whereas the Stennis Space Center is now home to the largest rocket engine test 
        complex in the United States and serves as the premier rocket-propulsion 
        testing facility in the United States, providing propulsion test 
        services for NASA, the Department of Defense, and commercial providers;
Whereas NASA has celebrated the end of a successful Space Shuttle program, 
        having conducted more than 2,000 total space shuttle main engine tests 
        and certified 54 flight engines at the Stennis Space Center;
Whereas, as NASA enters a new era in space exploration, the Stennis Space Center 
        will continue to play a vital role in the United States space program 
        and commercial space efforts;
Whereas the Stennis Space Center has grown into a unique Federal city that 
        includes more than 30 Federal, State, academic, and private 
        organizations, and numerous technology-based companies;
Whereas the companies and agencies at the Stennis Space Center share the cost of 
        operating and maintaining the facility, making the accomplishment of 
        missions by each entity more cost-effective;
Whereas the Stennis Space Center is home to--

    (1) the United States Naval Meteorology and Oceanography Command, which 
includes the largest concentration of oceanographers in the world;

    (2) the most powerful supercomputer of the United States Navy; and

    (3) the National Center for Critical Information Processing and 
Storage, which is facilitating the data center consolidation efforts by the 
Department of Homeland Security;

Whereas the Stennis Space Center played a critical role during the Deepwater 
        Horizon oil spill by providing unique resources and expertise on the 
        Gulf of Mexico ecosystem to predict the spread and impact of the spill;
Whereas the Stennis Space Center is an economic engine for Mississippi and 
        Louisiana, generating--

    (1) approximately 5,400 jobs;

    (2) a direct global economic impact of $875,000,000; and

    (3) a direct economic impact of $616,000,000 within a 50-mile radius; 
and

Whereas the Stennis Space Center is committed to continuing in the role of 
        inspiring the next generation of United States scientists, engineers, 
        and professionals: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) congratulates the National Aeronautics and Space 
        Administration on reaching the historic milestone of the 50th 
        anniversary of the John C. Stennis Space Center; and
            (2) honors the men and women who worked tirelessly to 
        design, build, and test the rocket engines used in the Apollo 
        and Space Shuttle programs in order to promote science, 
        engineering, innovation, and exploration to the benefit of the 
        United States and all humankind.
                                 <all>
