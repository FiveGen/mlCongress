                               RESOLUTION


 
Supporting the mission and goals of 2012 National Crime Victims' Rights 
Week to increase public awareness of the rights, needs, and concerns of 
          victims and survivors of crime in the United States.

Whereas each year, approximately 19,000,000 individuals in the United States are 
        victims of crime, including more than 4,000,000 victims of violent 
        crime;
Whereas a just society acknowledges the impact of crime on individuals, 
        families, and communities by ensuring that rights, resources, and 
        services are available to help rebuild lives;
Whereas although the United States has steadily expanded rights, protections, 
        and services for victims of crime, too many victims are still not able 
        to realize the hope and promise of these gains;
Whereas despite impressive accomplishments during the past 40 years in the 
        rights of and services available to crime victims, there remain many 
        challenges to ensure that all victims--

    (1) are treated with fairness, dignity, and respect;

    (2) are offered support and services regardless of whether the victims 
report crimes committed against them; and

    (3) are recognized as key participants within systems of justice in the 
United States when the victims do report crimes;

Whereas observing the rights of victims and treating victims with fairness, 
        dignity, and respect serve the public interest by--

    (1) engaging victims in the justice system;

    (2) inspiring respect for public authorities; and

    (3) promoting confidence in public safety;

Whereas the people of the United States recognize that we make our homes, 
        neighborhoods, and communities safer and stronger by serving victims of 
        crime and ensuring justice for all;
Whereas in each of the last 30 years, communities throughout the United States 
        have joined Congress and the Department of Justice in observing National 
        Crime Victims' Rights Week to celebrate a vision of a comprehensive and 
        just response to all victims of crime;
Whereas, the theme of 2012 National Crime Victims' Rights Week, celebrated on 
        April 22, 2012, through April 28, 2012, is ``Extending the Vision: 
        Reaching Every Victim,'' which highlights the importance of ensuring 
        that services are available for all victims of crime; and
Whereas the people of the United States appreciate the continued importance of 
        promoting victims' rights and honoring crime victims and those who 
        advocate on their behalf: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) supports the mission and goals of 2012 National Crime 
        Victims' Rights Week to increase public awareness of--
                    (A) the impact on victims and survivors of crime; 
                and
                    (B) the constitutional and statutory rights and 
                needs of those victims and survivors; and
            (2) recognizes that fairness, dignity, and respect comprise 
        the very foundation of how victims and survivors of crime 
        should be treated.
                                 <all>
