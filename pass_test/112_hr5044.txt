                of the United States and who is deceased as a result of 
                a service-connected disability, no amount which (but 
                for this paragraph) would otherwise be includible in 
                gross income by reason of the discharge (in whole or in 
                part) of such loan shall be includible in gross income 
                of any cosigner on such loan.
