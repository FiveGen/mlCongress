                               RESOLUTION


 
   Designating the week beginning September 19, 2011, as ``National 
 Hispanic-Serving Institutions Week'' and recognizing the achievements 
       of the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities.

Whereas Hispanic-serving institutions play an important role in educating many 
        underprivileged students and helping those students attain their full 
        potential through higher education;
Whereas Hispanic-serving institutions are degree-granting institutions that have 
        a full-time equivalent undergraduate enrollment of at least 25 percent 
        Hispanic students;
Whereas in 2010, there were 307 Hispanic-serving institutions in the United 
        States, enrolling 1,348,436 Hispanic students in nonprofit postsecondary 
        schools;
Whereas Hispanic-serving institutions are actively involved in stabilizing and 
        improving the communities in which the Hispanic-serving institutions are 
        located;
Whereas 54 percent of Hispanic students in the United States attend nonprofit, 
        postsecondary Hispanic-serving institutions;
Whereas celebrating the vast contributions of Hispanic-serving institutions to 
        the United States strengthens the culture of the United States;
Whereas the achievements and goals of Hispanic-serving institutions are 
        deserving of national recognition;
Whereas 2011 marks the 25th anniversary of the establishment of the Hispanic 
        Association of Colleges and Universities, an organization that works to 
        improve the capacity of Hispanic-serving institutions in helping 
        students across the United States succeed;
Whereas the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities fulfills its 
        mission by promoting the development of member colleges and 
        universities, improving access to, and the quality of, postsecondary 
        educational opportunities for Hispanic students, and meeting the needs 
        of business, industry, and government through the development and 
        sharing of resources, information, and expertise; and
Whereas the week beginning September 19, 2011, would be an appropriate week for 
        national recognition of Hispanic-serving institutions: Now, therefore, 
        be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes the achievements and goals of Hispanic-
        serving institutions across the United States;
            (2) recognizes the achievements of the Hispanic Association 
        of Colleges and Universities throughout the 25 years since the 
        establishment of the organization;
            (3) designates the week beginning September 19, 2011, as 
        ``National Hispanic-Serving Institutions Week''; and
            (4) calls on the people of the United States and interested 
        groups to observe the week with appropriate ceremonies, 
        activities, and programs to demonstrate support for Hispanic-
        serving institutions.
                                 <all>
