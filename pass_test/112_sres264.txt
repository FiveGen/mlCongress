                           September 13, 2011

             resolution; which was considered and agreed to

                               RESOLUTION


 
 Designating September 12, 2011, as ``National Day of Encouragement''.

Whereas negative images, stories, and influences in the day-to-day lives of the 
        people of the United States can detrimentally affect their emotional 
        well-being, interactions with others, and general demeanor;
Whereas a group of teenagers participating in a leadership forum at Harding 
        University in Searcy, Arkansas, identified a lack of encouragement as 
        one of the greatest problems facing young people today;
Whereas the youth of the United States need guidance, inspiration, and 
        reassurance to counteract this negativity and to develop the qualities 
        of character essential for future leadership in the United States;
Whereas a National Day of Encouragement would serve as a reminder to 
        counterbalance and overcome negative influences, and would also provide 
        much-needed encouragement and support to others;
Whereas, following the events of September 11, 2001, thousands of people made 
        sacrifices in order to bring help and healing to the victims and their 
        families, inspiring and encouraging the people of the United States; and
Whereas the renewed feelings of unity, hope, selflessness, and encouragement 
        that began on September 12, 2001, are the same feelings that the 
        National Day of Encouragement is meant to recapture and spread: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates September 12, 2011, as ``National Day of 
        Encouragement'';
            (2) acknowledges the importance of encouragement and 
        positive influences in the lives of all people; and
            (3) urges the people of the United States to encourage 
        others, whether through an act of service, a thoughtful letter, 
        or words of kindness and inspiration, and by that encouragement 
        to boost the morale of all people of the United States.
                                 <all>
