          Celebrating the end of slavery in the United States.

Whereas news of the end of slavery came late to frontier areas of the country, 
        especially in the American Southwest;
Whereas the African-Americans who had been slaves in the Southwest thereafter 
        celebrated Juneteenth as the anniversary of their emancipation;
Whereas their descendants handed down that tradition from generation to 
        generation as an inspiration and encouragement for future generations;
Whereas Juneteenth celebrations have thus been held for 130 years to honor the 
        memory of all those who endured slavery and especially those who moved 
        from slavery to freedom; and
Whereas their example of faith and strength of character remains a lesson for 
        all Americans today, regardless of background or region or race: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled, That--
            (1) the celebration of the end of slavery is an important 
        and enriching part of our country's history and heritage;
            (2) the celebration of the end of slavery provides an 
        opportunity for all Americans to learn more about our common 
        past and to better understand the experiences that have shaped 
        our Nation; and
            (3) a copy of this joint resolution be transmitted to the 
        National Association of Juneteenth Lineage as an expression of 
        appreciation for its role in promoting the observance of the 
        end of slavery.

            Passed the House of Representatives June 17, 1997.

            Attest:

                                                ROBIN H. CARLE,

                                                                 Clerk.
