H. Res. 558

                In the House of Representatives, U. S.,

                                                     February 17, 2012.
Whereas on February 5, 2008, William R. Clemens voluntarily appeared in 
        Washington, DC and was deposed by the Committee on Oversight and 
        Government Reform of the House of Representatives in connection with 
        that Committee's investigation into the use of steroids and other 
        performance-enhancing substances in professional sports, and in Major 
        League Baseball in particular;
Whereas the written transcript of Mr. Clemens' deposition, prepared by the 
        Official Reporters of the House, with an Errata Sheet prepared by Mr. 
        Clemens' counsel included as an Appendix, is the official House record 
        of that proceeding;
Whereas this deposition and Mr. Clemens' public appearance before the Committee 
        on Oversight and Government Reform on February 13, 2008, raised 
        significant questions about Mr. Clemens' truthfulness, as a result of 
        which the then Chair and ranking minority member jointly requested, on 
        or about February 27, 2008, that the Department of Justice investigate 
        whether Mr. Clemens committed perjury or knowingly made false statements 
        in the course of the deposition or his February 13, 2008, public 
        appearance;
Whereas the Department of Justice did in fact investigate whether Mr. Clemens 
        committed perjury or knowingly made false statements in the course of 
        his February 5, 2008, deposition and/or his February 13, 2008, public 
        appearance before the Committee;
Whereas as a result of the Department of Justice's investigation, Mr. Clemens 
        subsequently was indicted by a grand jury on one count of obstruction of 
        Congress in violation of sections 1505 and 1515(b) of title 18, United 
        States Code, 3 counts of making false statements in violation of 
        sections 1001(a)(2) and (c)(2) of title 18, United States Code, and 2 
        counts of perjury in violation of section 1621(1) of title 18, United 
        States Code;
Whereas the Department of Justice has requested via letter that the House 
        voluntarily provide to it a copy of the on-the-record portions of an 
        audio backup file of Mr. Clemens' deposition;
Whereas by the privileges and rights of the House of Representatives, an audio 
        backup file of Mr. Clemens' deposition may not be taken from the 
        possession or control of the Clerk of the House of Representatives by 
        mandate of process of the article III courts of the United States, and 
        may not be provided pursuant to requests by the court or the parties to 
        United States of America v. Clemens except at the direction of the 
        House; and
Whereas it is the judgment of the House of Representatives that, in the 
        particular circumstances of this case, providing a copy of the on-the-
        record portions of an audio backup file of Mr. Clemens' deposition to 
        the prosecuting attorneys in the case of United States v. Clemens would 
        promote the ends of justice in a manner consistent with the privileges 
        and rights of the House: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives directs the Clerk of the House 
to provide for use at trial a copy of the on-the-record portions of the audio 
backup file of the deposition of William R. Clemens that was conducted by the 
Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on February 5, 2008, to the 
prosecuting attorneys in the case of United States of America v. Clemens, No. 
1:10-cr-00223-RBW (D.D.C.).
            Attest:

                                                                          Clerk.
