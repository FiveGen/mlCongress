                                 AN ACT


 
To amend the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 to terminate 
     the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury to provide new 
   assistance under the Home Affordable Modification Program, while 
preserving assistance to homeowners who were already extended an offer 
  to participate in the Program, either on a trial or permanent basis.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``The HAMP Termination Act of 2011''.

SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) According to the Department of the Treasury--
                    (A) the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) 
                is designed to ``help as many as 3 to 4 million 
                financially struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure by 
                modifying loans to a level that is affordable for 
                borrowers now and sustainable over the long term''; and
                    (B) as of February 2011, only 607,600 active 
                permanent mortgage modifications were made under HAMP.
            (2) Many homeowners whose HAMP modifications were canceled 
        suffered because they made futile payments and some of those 
        homeowners were even forced into foreclosure.
            (3) The Special Inspector General for TARP reported that 
        HAMP ``benefits only a small portion of distressed homeowners, 
        offers others little more than false hope, and in certain cases 
        causes more harm than good''.
            (4) Approximately $30 billion was obligated by the 
        Department of the Treasury to HAMP, however, approximately only 
        $840 million has been disbursed.
            (5) Terminating HAMP would save American taxpayers 
        approximately $1.4 billion, according to the Congressional 
        Budget Office.

SEC. 3. TERMINATION OF AUTHORITY.

    Section 120 of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (12 
U.S.C. 5230) is amended by adding at the end the following new 
subsection:
    ``(c) Termination of Authority To Provide New Assistance Under the 
Home Affordable Modification Program.--
            ``(1) In general.--Except as provided under paragraph (2),

        Secretary may not provide any assistance under the Home 
        Affordable Modification Program under the Making Home 
        Affordable initiative of the Secretary, authorized under this 
        Act, on behalf of any homeowner.
            ``(2) Protection of existing obligations on behalf of 
        homeowners already extended an offer to participate in the 
        program.--Paragraph (1) shall not apply with respect to 
        assistance provided on behalf of a homeowner who, before the 
        date of the enactment of this subsection, was extended an offer

        trial or permanent basis.
