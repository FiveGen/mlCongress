                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION

Whereas Staff Sergeant Salvatore Giunta of the United States Army, a native of 
        Hiawatha, Iowa, was awarded the Medal of Honor by President Obama on 
        November 16, 2010;
Whereas the Medal of Honor is the highest honor awarded to members of the Armed 
        Forces for valor in combat;
Whereas the official citation awarding the Medal of Honor to Staff Sergeant 
        Giunta states that Staff Sergeant Giunta ``distinguished himself 
        conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above 
        and beyond the call of duty in action with an armed enemy in the 
        Korengal Valley, Afghanistan, on October 25, 2007'';
Whereas Staff Sergeant Giunta joins an elite group of Medal of Honor recipients 
        dating back to the Civil War;
Whereas the production and distribution of a medal of honor recognizing 
        individual valor was first proposed by a fellow Iowan, Senator James W. 
        Grimes, and the Secretary of the Navy was authorized to award the first 
        ``medals of honor'' under section 7 of the Act of December 21, 1861 (12 
        Stat. 330; chapter I);
Whereas Staff Sergeant Giunta is the first living recipient of the Medal of 
        Honor since the Vietnam War;
Whereas Staff Sergeant Giunta displayed true courage in the face of enemy fire, 
        risking his own life for the benefit of an injured soldier;
Whereas the actions of Staff Sergeant Giunta represent the highest values of the 
        Army and the United States;
Whereas Staff Sergeant Giunta has demonstrated humility and dedication to his 
        fellow soldiers on numerous occasions, stating that the Medal of Honor 
        does not belong to him alone, but also to his fellow soldiers, both 
        living and dead, for whom he holds the Medal of Honor in trust; and
Whereas the brave actions of Staff Sergeant Giunta, which went above and beyond 
        the call of duty, as well as the modesty and selfless service exhibited 
        by Staff Sergeant Giunta, stand as the embodiment of the best attributes 
        of the people of the United States: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring), 
That Congress--
            (1) honors the service and sacrifice of Staff Sergeant 
        Salvatore Giunta of the United States Army, who is the first 
        living recipient of the Medal of Honor since the Vietnam War; 
        and
            (2) encourages the people of the United States to recognize 
        the valor and heroism exhibited by Staff Sergeant Giunta.

            Passed the Senate January 25 (legislative day, January 5), 
      2011.

            Attest:

                                                             Secretary.
