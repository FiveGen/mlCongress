                             April 5, 2011

                               RESOLUTION


 
         Designating April 2011 as ``Tsunami Awareness Month.''

Whereas a tsunami is a series of ocean or sea waves generated by a sea floor 
        disturbance, such as an earthquake, landslide, volcanic eruption, or 
        meteorite;
Whereas a tsunami could occur during any season and at any time;
Whereas a tsunami is a threat to life and property for all coastal communities, 
        and tsunamis have caused serious injuries and millions of dollars in 
        property damage in the United States;
Whereas the danger posed by a tsunami cannot be eliminated, but the impact of a 
        tsunami can be mitigated through community preparedness, timely 
        warnings, and effective response;
Whereas tsunamis historically have posed the greatest hazard to Hawaii, Alaska, 
        California, Oregon, Washington, American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth 
        of the Northern Mariana Islands, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and 
        the Virgin Islands, tsunamis also pose risks to all ocean coasts of the 
        United States;
Whereas Federal, State, and local officials have partnered to coordinate a 
        national effort to reduce the impact of tsunamis through the National 
        Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program;
Whereas the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Weather 
        Service operates 2 tsunami warning centers, the Pacific Tsunami Warning 
        Center and the West Coast and Alaska Tsunami Warning Center, that detect 
        potential tsunamis and issue warnings;
Whereas Tsunami Awareness Month provides an opportunity to highlight the 
        importance of tsunami preparedness and to encourage the people of the 
        United States to take steps to be better prepared for tsunamis at home, 
        work, and school;
Whereas the people of the United States can prepare for tsunamis by finding out 
        if their home, school, workplace or other frequently visited locations 
        are in tsunami hazard areas, and by identifying evacuation routes; and
Whereas additional information about tsunami preparedness may be obtained 
        through TsunamiReady at National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 
        at www.tsunamiready.noaa.gov: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates April 2011 as ``Tsunami Awareness Month''; 
        and
            (2) encourages the Federal Government, States, localities, 
        schools, nonprofit organizations, businesses, and other 
        applicable entities, along with the people of the United 
        States, to observe Tsunami Awareness Month with appropriate 
        events and activities to promote tsunami preparedness.
                                 <all>
