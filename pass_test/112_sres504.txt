                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing support for the International Olympic Committee to recognize 
  with a minute of silence at the 2012 Olympics Opening Ceremony the 
        athletes and others killed at the 1972 Munich Olympics.

Whereas, in September 1972, in the midst of the Munich Olympics, the core spirit 
        of the Olympics was violated when members of the Black September 
        Palestinian terrorist group murdered eleven members of the Israeli 
        Olympic Team consisting of athletes, coaches, and referees;
Whereas one West German police officer was also killed in the terrorist attack;
Whereas the international community was deeply touched by the brutal murders at 
        the Munich Olympics and memorials have been placed around the world, 
        including in Rockland County, New York, United States; Manchester, 
        United Kingdom; Tel Aviv, Israel; and Munich, Germany;
Whereas the International Olympic Committee has an obligation and the ability to 
        fully and publicly promote the ideals embodied in the Olympic Charter, 
        which states, ``The goal of Olympism is to place sport at the service of 
        the harmonious development of humankind, with a view to promoting a 
        peaceful society concerned with the preservation of human dignity.''
Whereas no opening ceremonies of any Olympics since 1972 have marked an official 
        recognition of the terrorist attack that brutally betrayed the vision of 
        the Olympic Games; and
Whereas the London Olympic Games in 2012 will mark four decades since this act 
        of terror took place without a full and public commemoration of the 
        gravity of this tragic event for all Olympians and all humankind: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) should observe a minute of silence to commemorate the 
        40th anniversary of the 1972 Munich Olympics terrorist attack 
        and remember those who lost their lives;
            (2) urges the International Olympic Committee to take the 
        opportunity afforded by the 40th anniversary of the 1972 Munich 
        Olympics terrorist attack to remind the world that the Olympics 
        were established to send a message of hope and peace through 
        sport and athletic competition; and
            (3) urges the International Olympic Committee to recognize 
        with a minute of silence at the 2012 Olympics Opening Ceremony 
        those who lost their lives at the 1972 Munich Olympics in an 
        effort to reject and repudiate terrorism as antithetical to the 
        Olympic goal of peaceful competition.
                                 <all>
