                               RESOLUTION


 
 To authorize the production of records by the Committee on Commerce, 
                      Science, and Transportation.

Whereas, the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation conducted an 
        investigation into unauthorized charges on telephone bills;
Whereas, the Committee has received a request from a state law enforcement 
        official for access to records of the Committee's investigation;
Whereas, by the privileges of the Senate of the United States and Rule XI of the 
        Standing Rules of the Senate, no evidence under the control or in the 
        possession of the Senate can, by administrative or judicial process, be 
        taken from such control or possession but by permission of the Senate;
Whereas, when it appears that evidence under the control or in the possession of 
        the Senate is needed for the promotion of justice, the Senate will take 
        such action as will promote the ends of justice consistent with the 
        privileges of the Senate: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of the 
Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, acting jointly, are 
authorized to provide to law enforcement officials, regulatory 
agencies, and other entities or individuals duly authorized by federal, 
state, or local governments, records of the Committee's investigation 
into unauthorized charges on telephone bills.
