H. Res. 556

                In the House of Representatives, U. S.,

                                                         March 1, 2012.
Whereas the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the 
        International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights recognize that 
        every individual has ``the right to freedom of thought, conscience and 
        religion'', which includes the ``freedom to change his religion or 
        belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in 
        public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, 
        practice, worship and observance'';
Whereas Iran is a member of the United Nations and signatory to both the 
        Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on 
        Civil and Political Rights;
Whereas the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights 
        in Iran has reported that religious minorities, including Nematullahi 
        Sufi Muslims, Sunnis, Baha'is, and Christians, face human rights 
        violations in Iran;
Whereas in recent years, there has been a significant increase in the number of 
        incidents of Iranian authorities raiding religious services, detaining 
        worshippers and religious leaders, and harassing and threatening members 
        of religious minorities;
Whereas the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights 
        in Iran has reported that Iranian intelligence officials are known to 
        threaten Christian converts with arrest and apostasy charges if they do 
        not return to Islam;
Whereas the Department of State's most recent report on International Religious 
        Freedom, released on September 13, 2011, states that Iran's ``laws and 
        policies severely restrict freedom of religion,'' and notes ``government 
        imprisonment, harassment, intimidation, and discrimination based on 
        religious beliefs'' including ``death sentences for apostasy or 
        evangelism'';
Whereas in October 2009, Youcef Nadarkhani, an Iranian Christian, protested an 
        Iranian law that would impose Islam on his Christian children;
Whereas in September 2010, an Iranian court accused Youcef Nadarkhani of 
        abandoning the Islamic faith of his ancestors, and condemned him to 
        death for apostasy;
Whereas the Iranian court sentenced Youcef Nadarkhani to death by hanging;
Whereas on December 5, 2010, Youcef Nadarkhani appealed his conviction and 
        sentence to the Supreme Revolutionary Court in Qom, Iran, and the court 
        held that if it could be proven that he was a practicing Muslim in 
        adulthood, his death sentence should be carried out unless he recants 
        his Christian faith and adopts Islam;
Whereas from September 25 to September 28, 2011, an Iranian court held hearings 
        to determine if Youcef Nadarkhani was a practicing Muslim in adulthood, 
        and held that he had abandoned the faith of his ancestors and must be 
        sentenced to death if he does not recant his faith;
Whereas on numerous occasions the judiciary of Iran offered to commute Youcef 
        Nadarkhani's sentence if he would recant his faith;
Whereas numerous Government of Iran officials have attempted to coerce Youcef 
        Nadarkhani to recant his Christian faith and accept Islam in exchange 
        for his freedom;
Whereas Youcef Nadarkhani continues to refuse to recant his faith;
Whereas the Government of Iran continues to indefinitely imprison Youcef 
        Nadarkhani for choosing to practice Christianity; and
Whereas the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights 
        in Iran has reported that, at the time of his report, on October 19, 
        2011, Iran had secretly executed 146 people during that calendar year, 
        and in 2010, Iran secretly executed more than 300 people: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) condemns the Government of Iran for its ongoing and systemic 
        violations of the human rights of the Iranian people, including the 
        state-sponsored persecution of religious minorities in Iran, and its 
        continued failure to uphold its international obligations, including 
        with respect to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the 
        International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights;
            (2) calls for the Government of Iran to exonerate and immediately 
        and unconditionally release Youcef Nadarkhani and all other individuals 
        held or charged on account of their religious or political beliefs;
            (3) calls on the Administration to designate additional Iranian 
        officials, as appropriate, for human rights abuses pursuant to section 
        105 of the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment 
        Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-195); and
            (4) reaffirms that freedom of religious belief and practice is a 
        universal human right and a fundamental individual freedom that every 
        government must protect and must never abridge.
            Attest:

                                                                          Clerk.
