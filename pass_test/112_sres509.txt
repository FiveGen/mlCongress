                               RESOLUTION


 
Recognizing Major League Baseball as an important part of the cultural 
history of American society, celebrating the 2012 Major League Baseball 
All-Star Game, and honoring Kansas City, Missouri, as the host city of 
                        the 83rd All-Star Game.

Whereas Major League Baseball's All-Star Game, the Midsummer Classic, occurs 
        once a year between players from the American and National Leagues, 
        allowing baseball fans, players, and managers to select players to 
        represent each league;
Whereas the first All-Star Game, held as part of the 1933 World's Fair in 
        Chicago, Illinois, at Comiskey Park was intended to be a one-time event, 
        yet its widespread success led to the establishment of the game as an 
        annual tradition;
Whereas the Major League Baseball All-Star Game showcases the best baseball 
        players in the major leagues and all across the world, giving baseball 
        fans the opportunity to select the starting players;
Whereas, since 1933, the Major League Baseball All-Star Game has taken place 
        every year but one, 1945, in the midst of World War II;
Whereas the 83rd edition of the Major League Baseball All-Star Game for the 2012 
        season will be held on July 10, 2012, at Kauffman Stadium in Kansas 
        City, Missouri, the home of the Kansas City Royals;
Whereas the event will mark the third time the All-Star Game has been played in 
        Kansas City, with Kauffman Stadium, then named Royals Stadium, last 
        hosting the event in 1973, the stadium's inaugural year;
Whereas the event was also held at Municipal Stadium in 1960, when it was the 
        home of the Athletics;
Whereas the illustrious baseball history of Kansas City, Missouri, includes the 
        Royals' 1985 World Series Championship, the contributions of Jackie 
        Robinson, Buck O'Neil, and others to the Kansas City Monarchs, and Lou 
        Gehrig's final three innings of play in a 1939 exhibition against the 
        Kansas City Blues;
Whereas, as part of Major League Baseball's All-Star Summer celebration, Major 
        League Baseball will host a number of events in the Greater Kansas City 
        region leading up to the All-Star Game, benefitting the Kansas City 
        community as a whole;
Whereas Major League Baseball and the Kansas City Royals will hold numerous 
        charity events throughout the region, including an All-Star Game Charity 
        5K & Fun Run, with all Major League Baseball proceeds being donated 
        equally between three cancer charities, Stand Up To Cancer, the Prostate 
        Cancer Foundation and Susan G. Komen for the Cure, Greater Kansas City;
Whereas, as part of the All-Star Summer celebration, Major League Baseball will 
        provide funding to help renovate two baseball fields owned by the Kansas 
        City Missouri Parks and Recreation Department, Mulkey Square Park and 
        Satchel Paige Stadium;
Whereas the fields will be used regularly by local Reviving Baseball in Inner 
        Cities leagues and by Guadalupe Center Youth Baseball;
Whereas Kansas City, Missouri, has worked to preserve the history of the Negro 
        Baseball Leagues by establishing the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum, and 
        as part of the All-Star Game summer events, funding will be provided for 
        a new traveling exhibit focusing on Negro League Players who, after 
        Jackie Robinson broke the baseball color barrier, began participating in 
        All-Star Games in 1949;
Whereas Kansas City, Missouri, known for world-class barbeque, rich jazz 
        history, and a legacy of professional sports, including the Royals' 1985 
        World Series Championship, will play host to the 83rd All-Star Game, and 
        will be showcased in the forefront of baseball history as the All-Star 
        Game is broadcast world wide; and
Whereas the 2012 Major League Baseball All-Star Game in Kansas City, Missouri, 
        will be a unique and unforgettable experience for baseball fans across 
        the State of Missouri and throughout the country: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes Kansas City, Missouri, as the host city for 
        the 83rd Major League Baseball All-Star Game and supports 
        efforts to achieve an unforgettable Midsummer Classic baseball 
        experience for all fans; and
            (2) recognizes Major League Baseball for sponsoring the 
        All-Star Game and for its efforts in energizing the Kansas City 
        community by hosting a number of baseball-related events that 
        benefit numerous charities, focusing on fan appreciation and 
        youth involvement, and emphasizing the continued appreciation 
        of baseball as America's favorite pastime.
