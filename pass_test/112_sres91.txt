                               RESOLUTION


 
 Supporting the goals and ideals of Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week.

Whereas multiple sclerosis can impact men and women of all ages, races, and 
        ethnicities;
Whereas more than 400,000 Americans live with multiple sclerosis;
Whereas approximately 2,100,000 people worldwide have been diagnosed with 
        multiple sclerosis;
Whereas every hour of every day, someone is newly diagnosed with multiple 
        sclerosis;
Whereas an estimated 8,000 to 10,000 children and adolescents are living with 
        multiple sclerosis;
Whereas the exact cause of multiple sclerosis is still unknown;
Whereas the symptoms of multiple sclerosis are unpredictable and vary from 
        person to person;
Whereas there is no laboratory test available that definitively diagnoses a case 
        of multiple sclerosis;
Whereas multiple sclerosis is not genetic, contagious, or directly inherited, 
        but studies show that there are genetic factors that indicate that 
        certain individuals may be susceptible to the disease;
Whereas multiple sclerosis symptoms occur when an immune system attack affects 
        the myelin in nerve fibers of the central nervous system, damaging or 
        destroying the myelin and replacing the myelin with scar tissue, thereby 
        interfering with or preventing the transmission of nerve signals;
Whereas in rare cases, multiple sclerosis is so progressive that the disease is 
        fatal;
Whereas there is no known cure for multiple sclerosis;
Whereas the Multiple Sclerosis Coalition, an affiliation of multiple sclerosis 
        organizations dedicated to the enhancement of the quality of life for 
        all those affected by multiple sclerosis, recognizes and celebrates 
        Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week;
Whereas the mission of the Multiple Sclerosis Coalition is to increase 
        opportunities for cooperation and provide greater opportunity to 
        leverage the effective use of resources for the benefit of the multiple 
        sclerosis community;
Whereas the Multiple Sclerosis Coalition recognizes and celebrates Multiple 
        Sclerosis Awareness Week for 1 week in March of each year;
Whereas the goals of Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week are--

    (1) to invite people to join the movement to end multiple sclerosis;

    (2) to encourage each individual in the United States to do something 
that demonstrates a commitment to moving toward a world free of multiple 
sclerosis; and

    (3) to acknowledge those individuals who have dedicated their time and 
talent to helping to promote multiple sclerosis research and programs; and

Whereas in 2011, the week of March 14, 2011, through March 20, 2011, has been 
        designated as Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of Multiple Sclerosis 
        Awareness Week;
            (2) encourages the States, territories, possessions, and 
        localities of the United States to support the goals and ideals 
        of Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week by issuing proclamations 
        designating Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week;
            (3) encourages media organizations to participate in 
        Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week by helping to educate the 
        public about multiple sclerosis;
            (4) commends the efforts of the States, territories, 
        possessions, and localities of the United States that support 
        the goals and ideals of Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week;
            (5) recognizes and reaffirms the commitment of the United 
        States to creating a world free of multiple sclerosis by--
                    (A) promoting awareness about people who are living 
                with multiple sclerosis; and
                    (B) promoting new education programs, supporting 
                research, and expanding access to medical treatment;
            (6) recognizes all people in the United States living with 
        multiple sclerosis and expresses gratitude to their family 
        members and friends who are a source of love and encouragement 
        to those individuals; and
            (7) salutes the health care professionals and medical 
        researchers who--
                    (A) provide assistance to those individuals in the 
                United States living with multiple sclerosis; and
                    (B) continue to work to find ways to stop the 
                progression of the disease, restore nerve function, and 
                end multiple sclerosis forever.
                                 <all>
