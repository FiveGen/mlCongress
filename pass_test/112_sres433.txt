               April 24 (legislative day, April 23), 2012

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
  Designating April 2012 as ``National Child Abuse Prevention Month''.

Whereas in 2010, approximately 695,000 children were determined to be victims of 
        abuse or neglect;
Whereas in 2010, more than 1,530 children died as a result of abuse or neglect;
Whereas in 2010, an estimated 79.4 percent of the children who died due to abuse 
        or neglect were under the age of 4;
Whereas in 2010, of the children under the age of 4 who died due to abuse or 
        neglect, 47.7 percent were under the age of 1;
Whereas abused or neglected children have a higher risk for developing health 
        problems in adulthood, including alcoholism, depression, drug abuse, 
        eating disorders, obesity, suicide, and certain chronic diseases;
Whereas a National Institute of Justice study indicated that abused or neglected 
        children--

    (1) are 11 times more likely to be arrested for criminal behavior as 
juveniles; and

    (2) are 2.7 times more likely to be arrested for violent and criminal 
behavior as adults;

Whereas an estimated one-third of abused or neglected children grow up to abuse 
        or neglect their own children;
Whereas providing community-based services to families impacted by child abuse 
        or neglect may be far less costly than--

    (1) the emotional and physical damage inflicted on children who have 
been abused or neglected;

    (2) providing other services to abused or neglected children, including 
child protective, law enforcement, court, foster care, or health care 
services; or

    (3) providing treatment to adults recovering from child abuse; and

Whereas child abuse and neglect have long-term economic and societal costs: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates April 2012 as ``National Child Abuse 
        Prevention Month'';
            (2) recognizes and applauds the national and community 
        organizations that work to promote awareness about child abuse 
        and neglect, including by identifying risk factors and 
        developing prevention strategies;
            (3) supports the proclamation issued by President Obama 
        declaring April 2012 to be ``National Child Abuse Prevention 
        Month''; and
            (4) should increase public awareness of prevention programs 
        relating to child abuse and neglect, and continue to work with 
        States to reduce the incidence of child abuse and neglect in 
        the United States.
