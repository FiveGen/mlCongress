        facilities, and holds an operating license issued by the 
        Federal Communications Commission under the authority of title 
        III of the Communications Act of 1934.''.
    (e) Amendment of Federal Sentencing Guidelines for Wireless 
Telephone Cloning.--
            (1) In general.--Pursuant to its authority under section 
        994 of title 28, United States Code, the United States 
        Sentencing Commission shall review and amend the Federal 
        sentencing guidelines and the policy statements of the 
        Commission, if appropriate, to provide an appropriate penalty 
        for offenses involving the cloning of wireless telephones 
        (including offenses involving an attempt or conspiracy to clone 
        a wireless telephone).
            (2) Factors for consideration.--In carrying out this 
        subsection, the Commission shall consider, with respect to the 
        offenses described in paragraph (1)--
                    (A) the range of conduct covered by the offenses;
                    (B) the existing sentences for the offenses;
                    (C) the extent to which the value of the loss 
                caused by the offenses (as defined in the Federal 
                sentencing guidelines) is an adequate measure for 
                establishing penalties under the Federal sentencing 
                guidelines;
                    (D) the extent to which sentencing enhancements 
                within the Federal sentencing guidelines and the 
                court's authority to sentence above the applicable 
                guideline range are adequate to ensure punishment at or 
                near the maximum penalty for the most egregious conduct 
                covered by the offenses;
                    (E) the extent to which the Federal sentencing 
                guideline sentences for the offenses have been 
                constrained by statutory maximum penalties;
                    (F) the extent to which Federal sentencing 
                guidelines for the offenses adequately achieve the 
                purposes of sentencing set forth in section 3553(a)(2) 
                of title 18, United States Code;
                    (G) the relationship of Federal sentencing 
                guidelines for the offenses to the Federal sentencing 
                guidelines for other offenses of comparable 
                seriousness; and
                    (H) any other factor that the Commission considers 
                to be appropriate.
