                               RESOLUTION


 
  Commemorating the victory of Loyola University Maryland in the 2012 
         NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse National Championship.

Whereas on May 28, 2012, Loyola University Maryland won its first NCAA Division 
        I Men's Lacrosse National Championship and the first Division I national 
        title in the history of the school;
Whereas Loyola is the smallest school in NCAA history to win the Division I 
        Men's Lacrosse National Championship, with only 3,863 undergraduate 
        students;
Whereas the Loyola Greyhounds finished the men's lacrosse season with a record 
        of 18 wins and 1 loss;
Whereas the Loyola Greyhounds set a NCAA record for the fewest goals allowed 
        during a men's lacrosse championship game;
Whereas 5 members of the Loyola Greyhounds, Joe Fletcher, Josh Hawkins, Eric 
        Lusby, Scott Ratliff, and Jack Runkel, were named members of the All-
        Tournament team;
Whereas Loyola senior Eric Lusby was named the Most Outstanding Player of the 
        2012 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse National Championship after scoring 
        4 goals in the title game, while also setting a tournament record with a 
        total of 17 goals in 4 games;
Whereas sophomore goalie Jack Runkel had 6 saves in the championship game, 
        holding the University of Maryland to only 3 goals;
Whereas the 18 wins by the Loyola Greyhounds this season set a program record;
Whereas Loyola became just the ninth team to win an NCAA Division I Men's 
        Lacrosse National Championship since the first championship was held in 
        1971;
Whereas the Loyola Greyhounds secured their victory in only their second 
        appearance in a national championship, having been defeated by Syracuse 
        in 1990;
Whereas the vision and leadership of the Rev. Brian Linnane, S.J. and Jim 
        Paquette, Loyola University's President and Athletic Director, 
        respectively, were instrumental in bringing academic and athletic 
        success, as well as national recognition, to Loyola University Maryland; 
        and
Whereas the 2012 Loyola University Maryland men's lacrosse team has brought 
        great honor and pride to their university, the State of Maryland, and 
        the United States: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) congratulates the Loyola University Maryland Greyhounds 
        for winning the 2012 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse National 
        Championship;
            (2) recognizes the achievements of the players, coaches, 
        students, and staff whose hard work and dedication were key to 
        Loyola's victory in the championship game; and
            (3) requests the Secretary of the Senate to transmit for 
        appropriate display an enrolled copy of this resolution to 
        Loyola University President Rev. Brian Linnane, S.J. and Loyola 
        University Men's Lacrosse Head Coach Charley Toomey.
