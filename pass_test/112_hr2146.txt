                constitute travel expenses for purposes of this 
                subsection. The guidelines shall identify specific 
                expenses, and classes of expenses, that are to be 
                treated as travel expenses.
                    (B) Exemption for military travel.--The guidelines

                travel expenses in determining what expenses constitute 
                travel expenses. Military travel expenses shall include 
                travel expenses involving military combat, the training 
                or deployment of uniformed military personnel, and such 
                other travel expenses as are determined under the 
                guidelines.

                    (B) the term ``conference'' has the meaning given

                subsection (a)).
            (2) Public availability of conference materials.--Each 
        agency shall post on the public Internet website of that agency 
        detailed information on any presentation made by any employee 
        of that agency at a conference, including--

                head of the agency that there is no conflict of

                    (B) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this 
                paragraph shall be construed to preclude an agency from 
                receiving financial support or other assistance from a 
                foundation or other non-Federal source to pay or defray 
                the costs of a conference the total cost of which 
                exceeds $500,000.
