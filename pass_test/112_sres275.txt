                               RESOLUTION


 
  Designating October 30, 2011, as a national day of remembrance for 
                    nuclear weapons program workers.

Whereas, since World War II, hundreds of thousands of men and women, including 
        uranium miners, millers, and haulers, have served the United States by 
        building the nuclear defense weapons of the United States;
Whereas these dedicated workers paid a high price for their service to develop a 
        nuclear weapons program for the benefit of the United States, including 
        having developed disabling or fatal illnesses;
Whereas the Senate recognized the contribution, service, and sacrifice these 
        patriotic men and women made for the defense of the United States in 
        Senate Resolution 151, 111th Congress, agreed to May 20, 2009, and 
        Senate Resolution 653, 111th Congress, agreed to September 28, 2010;
Whereas a national day of remembrance time capsule has been crossing the United 
        States, collecting artifacts and the stories of the nuclear workers 
        relating to the nuclear defense era of the United States;
Whereas these stories and artifacts reinforce the importance of recognizing 
        these nuclear workers; and
Whereas these patriotic men and women deserve to be recognized for the 
        contribution, service, and sacrifice they have made for the defense of 
        the United States: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates October 30, 2011, as a national day of 
        remembrance for nuclear weapons program workers, including 
        uranium miners, millers, and haulers, of the United States; and
            (2) encourages the people of the United States to support 
        and participate in appropriate ceremonies, programs, and other 
        activities to commemorate October 30, 2011, as a national day 
        of remembrance for past and present workers in the nuclear 
        weapons program of the United States.
                                 <all>
