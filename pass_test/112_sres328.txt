   Designating the week of November 14 through 20, 2011, as ``Global 
                      Entrepreneurship Week/USA''.

Whereas research has shown that between 1980 and 2005 the majority of jobs in 
        the United States were created by entrepreneurs and the young companies 
        of those entrepreneurs;
Whereas the economy and society of the United States, as well as the country as 
        a whole, have greatly benefitted from the everyday use of breakthrough 
        innovations developed and brought to market by entrepreneurs;
Whereas Global Entrepreneurship Week/USA is an initiative to celebrate the 
        innovators and job creators who launch startups that bring ideas to 
        life, drive economic growth, and improve human welfare;
Whereas Global Entrepreneurship Week/USA helps existing and aspiring 
        entrepreneurs to acquire the knowledge, skills, and networks needed to 
        create vibrant enterprises that will improve the lives and communities 
        of the entrepreneurs;
Whereas, in 2010, more than 445,896 individuals participated in the more than 
        3,200 entrepreneurial activities held in the United States alone during 
        Global Entrepreneurship Week;
Whereas, in 2010, more than 1,300 partner organizations participated in Global 
        Entrepreneurship Week/USA, including startup accelerators, business 
        incubators, chambers of commerce, institutions of higher education, high 
        schools, businesses, and State and local governments; and
Whereas, in 2011, thousands of organizations in the United States will join in 
        the celebration by planning activities designed to inspire, connect, 
        mentor, and engage the next generation of entrepreneurs throughout 
        Global Entrepreneurship Week/USA: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates the week of November 14 through 20, 2011, as 
        ``Global Entrepreneurship Week/USA''; and
            (2) supports the goals of Global Entrepreneurship Week/USA, 
        including--
                    (A) inspiring young people everywhere to embrace 
                innovation, imagination, and creativity; and
                    (B) training the next generation of entrepreneurial 
                leaders.
