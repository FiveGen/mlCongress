                               RESOLUTION


 
To authorize document production in United States v. Douglas D. Hampton 
                               (D.D.C.).

Whereas, in the case of United States v. Douglas D. Hampton, Crim. No. 11-085 
        (D.D.C.), pending in the United States District Court for the District 
        of Columbia, documents that have been produced to the United States 
        Department of Justice by offices of the Senate in earlier related 
        proceedings may be needed for use in this proceeding;
Whereas, by the privileges of the Senate of the United States and Rule XI of the 
        Standing Rules of the Senate, no evidence under the control or in the 
        possession of the Senate may, by the judicial or administrative process, 
        be taken from such control or possesion but by permission of the Senate;
Whereas, when it appears that evidence under the control or in the possession of 
        the Senate may promote the administration of justice, the Senate will 
        take such action as will promote the ends of justice consistent with the 
        privileges of the Senate: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That records that have been produced by offices of the 
Senate in connection with investigation by the Department of Justice 
are authorized to be used in the case of United States v. Douglas D. 
Hampton and any related proceedings.
                                 <all>
