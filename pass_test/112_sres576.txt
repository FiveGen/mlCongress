                               RESOLUTION


 
 Celebrating the 50th anniversary of the signing of Public Law 87-788, 
an Act commonly known as the McIntire-Stennis Cooperative Forestry Act.

Whereas October 10, 2012, marks the 50th anniversary of the signing of Public 
        Law 87-788 (commonly known as the ``McIntire-Stennis Cooperative 
        Forestry Act'') (16 U.S.C. 582a et seq.), which authorized the Secretary 
        of Agriculture to encourage and assist States in conducting a program of 
        forestry research;
Whereas the McIntire-Stennis Cooperative Forestry Act was named for the 2 
        primary, bipartisan sponsors of the Act, Representative Clifford G. 
        McIntire of Maine and Senator John C. Stennis of Mississippi, who 
        recognized that research in forestry is the ``driving force behind 
        progress in developing and utilizing the Nation's forests'';
Whereas the McIntire-Stennis Cooperative Forestry Act recognized that forestry 
        research would be more effective nationwide if efforts among State-
        supported institutions of higher education were partnered and more 
        closely coordinated with forestry research activities in the Federal 
        Government;
Whereas Congressman McIntire and Senator Stennis stated a clear intent to 
        address the important need of the United States for increased numbers of 
        highly trained forestry scientists and other research professionals;
Whereas the McIntire-Stennis Cooperative Forestry Act has provided 5 decades of 
        base funding to establish and strengthen research and training capacity 
        in forestry at State-supported institutions of higher education;
Whereas funds provided by the Act to State-supported institutions of higher 
        education are highly leveraged with non-Federal funds;
Whereas university-based forestry research has provided an accumulated wealth of 
        science-based knowledge, skills, and technologies that have been 
        critical for sustaining United States forests for economic, ecological, 
        and social benefits;
Whereas funds provided by the McIntire-Stennis Cooperative Forestry Act for 
        forestry research at State-supported institutions of higher education 
        have provided significant graduate student support over the last 50 
        years, resulting in 8,500 master's degrees and 2,600 doctoral degrees;
Whereas the State-supported institutions of higher education that receive funds 
        under the McIntire-Stennis Cooperative Forestry Act conduct forestry 
        research in all 50 States and 4 territories of the United States, and 
        disseminate the results of those efforts locally, regionally, 
        nationally, and globally for the betterment of the communities of the 
        institutions, the United States, and the world; and
Whereas many State-supported institutions of higher education are celebrating 
        and commemorating the 50th anniversary of the signing of the McIntire-
        Stennis Cooperative Forestry Act: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) celebrates the 50th anniversary of the signing of 
        Public Law 87-788 (commonly known as the ``McIntire-Stennis 
        Cooperative Forestry Act'') (16 U.S.C. 582a et seq.) by 
        President John F. Kennedy;
            (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
        and celebrate the 50th anniversary of the signing of the 
        McIntire-Stennis Cooperative Forestry Act with appropriate 
        ceremonies and activities;
            (3) affirms the continuing importance and vitality of the 
        State-supported institutions of higher education conducting 
        forestry research and training supported by the McIntire-
        Stennis Cooperative Forestry Act; and
            (4) respectfully requests that the Secretary of the Senate 
        transmit to the National Association of University Forest 
        Resources Programs an enrolled copy of this resolution for 
        appropriate display.
