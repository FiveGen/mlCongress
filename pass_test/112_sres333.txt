                               RESOLUTION


 
   Welcoming and commending the Government of Japan for extending an 
official apology to all United States former prisoners of war from the 
Pacific War and establishing in 2010 a visitation program to Japan for 
          surviving veterans, family members, and descendants.

Whereas the United States and Japan have enjoyed a productive and successful 
        peace for over six decades, which has nurtured a strong and critical 
        alliance and deep economic ties that are vitally important to both 
        countries, the Asia-Pacific region, and the world;
Whereas the United States-Japan alliance is based on shared interests, 
        responsibilities, and values and the common support for political and 
        economic freedoms, human rights, and international law;
Whereas the United States-Japan alliance has been maintained by the 
        contributions and sacrifices of members of the United States Armed 
        Forces dedicated to Japan's defense and democracy;
Whereas, from December 7, 1941, to August 15, 1945, the Pacific War caused 
        profound damage and suffering to combatants and noncombatants alike;
Whereas, among those who suffered and sacrificed greatly were the men and women 
        of the United States Armed Forces who were captured by Imperial Japanese 
        forces during the Pacific War;
Whereas many United States prisoners of war were subject to brutal and inhumane 
        conditions and forced labor;
Whereas, according to the Congressional Research Service, an estimated 27,000 
        United States prisoners of war were held by Imperial Japanese forces and 
        nearly 40 percent perished;
Whereas the American Defenders of Bataan and Corregidor and its subsequent 
        Descendants Group have worked tirelessly to represent the thousands of 
        United States veterans who were held by Imperial Japanese forces as 
        prisoners of war during the Pacific War;
Whereas, on May 30, 2009, an official apology from the Government of Japan was 
        delivered by Japan's Ambassador to the United States Ichiro Fujisaki to 
        the last convention of the American Defenders of Bataan and Corregidor 
        stating, ``Today, I would like to convey to you the position of the 
        government of Japan on this issue. As former Prime Ministers of Japan 
        have repeatedly stated, the Japanese people should bear in mind that we 
        must look into the past and to learn from the lessons of history. We 
        extend a heartfelt apology for our country having caused tremendous 
        damage and suffering to many people, including prisoners of wars, those 
        who have undergone tragic experiences in the Bataan Peninsula, 
        Corregidor Island, in the Philippines, and other places.'';
Whereas, in 2010, the Government of Japan through its Ministry of Foreign 
        Affairs has established a new program of remembrance and understanding 
        that, for the first time, includes United States former prisoners of war 
        and their family members or other caregivers by inviting them to Japan 
        for exchange and friendship;
Whereas six United States former prisoners of war, each of whom was accompanied 
        by a family member, and two descendants of prisoners of war participated 
        in Japan's first Japanese/American POW Friendship Program from September 
        12, 2010, to September 19, 2010;
Whereas Japan's Foreign Minister Katsuya Okada on September 13, 2010, apologized 
        to all United States former prisoners of war on behalf of the Government 
        of Japan stating, ``You have all been through hardships during World War 
        II, being taken prisoner by the Japanese military, and suffered 
        extremely inhumane treatment. On behalf of the Japanese government and 
        as the foreign minister, I would like to offer you my heartfelt 
        apology.'';
Whereas Foreign Minister Okada stated that he expects the former prisoners of 
        war exchanges with the people of Japan will ``become a turning point in 
        burying their bitter feelings about the past and establishing a better 
        relationship between Japan and the United States'';
Whereas Japan's Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Tetsuro Fukuyama on September 13, 
        2010, apologized to United States former prisoners of war for the 
        ``immeasurable damage and suffering'' they experienced;
Whereas the participants of the first Japanese/American POW Friendship Program 
        appreciated the generosity and hospitality they received from the 
        Government and people of Japan during the Program and welcomed the 
        apology offered by Foreign Minister Okada and Deputy Chief Cabinet 
        Secretary Fukuyama;
Whereas the participants encourage the Government of Japan to continue this 
        program of visitation and friendship and expand it to support projects 
        for remembrance, documentation, and education; and
Whereas the United States former prisoners of war of Japan still await apologies 
        and remembrance from the successor firms of those private entities in 
        Japan that, in violation of the Third Geneva Convention and in 
        unmerciful conditions, used their labor for economic gain to sustain war 
        production: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) welcomes and commends the Government of Japan for 
        extending an official apology to all United States former 
        prisoners of war from the Pacific War and establishing in 2010 
        a visitation program to Japan for surviving veterans, their 
        families, and descendants;
            (2) appreciates the recent efforts by the Government of 
        Japan toward historic apologies for the maltreatment of United 
        States former prisoners of war;
            (3) requests that the Government of Japan continue its new 
        Japanese/American POW Friendship Program of reconciliation and 
        remembrance and expand it to educate the public and its school 
        children about the history of prisoners of war in Imperial 
        Japan;
            (4) requests that the Government of Japan respect the 
        wishes and sensibilities of the United States former prisoners 
        of war by supporting and encouraging programs for lasting 
        remembrance and reconciliation that recognize their sacrifices, 
        history, and forced labor;
            (5) acknowledges the work of the Department of State in 
        advocating for the United States prisoners of war from the 
        Pacific War; and
            (6) applauds the persistence, dedication, and patriotism of 
        the members and descendants of the American Defenders of Bataan 
        and Corregidor for their pursuit of justice and lasting peace.
