                               RESOLUTION


 
     Designating the month of August 2012 as ``National Registered 
                        Apprenticeship Month''.

Whereas 2012 marks the 75th anniversary of the enactment of the Act of August 
        16, 1937 (29 U.S.C. 50 et seq.) (commonly known as the ``National 
        Apprenticeship Act''), which established the national registered 
        apprenticeship system;
Whereas the State of Wisconsin created the first State registered apprenticeship 
        system in 1911;
Whereas the Act of August 16, 1937 (29 U.S.C. 50 et seq.) (commonly known as the 
        ``National Apprenticeship Act'') established a comprehensive system of 
        partnerships among employers, labor organizations, educational 
        institutions, and Federal and State governments, which has shaped skill 
        training for succeeding generations of United States workers;
Whereas for 75 years, the national registered apprenticeship system has provided 
        state of the art training using an model known as ``earn while you 
        learn'' that offers a pathway to the middle class and a sustainable 
        career for millions of workers in the United States;
Whereas the national registered apprenticeship system has grown to include 
        approximately 24,000 programs across the United States, providing 
        education and training for apprentices in emerging and high-growth 
        sectors, such as information technology and health care, as well as in 
        traditional industries;
Whereas the national registered apprenticeship system leverages approximately 
        $1,000,000,000 in private investment, reflecting the strong commitment 
        of the sponsors of the system, which include industry associations, 
        individual employers, and labor-management partnerships;
Whereas the national registered apprenticeship system is an important post-
        secondary pathway for United States workers, offering a combination of 
        academic and technical instruction with paid, on-the-job training, 
        resulting in a nationally and industry-recognized occupational 
        credential that ensures higher earnings for apprentices and a highly 
        skilled workforce for United States businesses;
Whereas the national registered apprenticeship system has continually modernized 
        and developed innovative training approaches to meet the workforce needs 
        of industry and address the evolving challenges of staying competitive 
        in the global economy;
Whereas the national registered apprenticeship system of the 21st century, as 
        envisioned by the Advisory Committee on Apprenticeship of the Secretary 
        of Labor and administered as a partnership between the Federal 
        Government and State apprenticeship programs, is positioned to produce 
        the highly skilled workers the United States economy needs now and in 
        the future; and
Whereas the celebration of National Registered Apprenticeship Month--

    (1) honors the industries that use the registered apprenticeship model;

    (2) encourages other industries that could benefit from the registered 
apprenticeship model to train United States workers using the model; and

    (3) recognizes the role the national registered apprenticeship system 
has played in preparing United States workers for jobs with family-
sustaining wages: Now, therefore, be it

    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates August 2012, as ``National Registered 
        Apprenticeship Month'';
            (2) celebrates the 101st anniversary of the enactment of 
        the first State registered apprenticeship law; and
            (3) celebrates the 75th anniversary of the enactment of the 
        Act of August 16, 1937 (29 U.S.C. 50 et seq.) (commonly known 
        as the ``National Apprenticeship Act'').
                                 <all>
