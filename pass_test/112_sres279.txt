                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                           September 23, 2011

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
   Expressing support for the designation of September 24, 2011, as 
                       ``Worldwide Day of Play''.

Whereas according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, since 1980, 
        obesity prevalence among children has almost tripled and approximately 
        12,500,000, or 17 percent, of children and adolescents in the United 
        States are obese;
Whereas according to the American Academy of Pediatrics study entitled ``The 
        Importance of Play in Promoting Healthy Child Development and 
        Maintaining Strong Parent-Child Bonds''--

    (1) play is essential to development because play contributes to the 
cognitive, physical, social, and emotional well-being of children and 
youth;

    (2) play offers an ideal opportunity for parents to engage fully with 
children; and

    (3) despite the benefits derived from play for both children and 
parents, time for free play has been significantly reduced for some 
children and youth in the United States;

Whereas Worldwide Day of Play is the centerpiece of The Big Help, the long-term 
        commitment of Nickelodeon to empower children and families by providing 
        the tools and information children and families need to take action on 
        the issues children and families care about;
Whereas in each of the 50 States and in 13 countries, including at United States 
        military bases around the globe, children and families celebrate 
        Worldwide Day of Play;
Whereas on September 24, 2011, Nickelodeon will host the 8th annual Worldwide 
        Day of Play;
Whereas in 2011, in collaboration with the Let's Move! campaign started by First 
        Lady Michelle Obama and the President's Council on Fitness, Sports and 
        Nutrition, the Nickelodeon Worldwide Day of Play will be held on the 
        Ellipse in Washington, District of Columbia;
Whereas September 24, 2011, would be an appropriate date to designate as 
        Worldwide Day of Play: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate supports the designation of September 24, 
2011, as ``Worldwide Day of Play''.
