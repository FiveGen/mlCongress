        3,281,008 acres of land, resulting in a devastating loss of life and 
        property;
Whereas, as of July 12, 2012, firefighters have battled fires all across the

Whereas, the brave men and women who fight wildfires on a daily basis help 
        minimize the displacement of individuals and protect against the loss of 
        life and property: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes the heroic efforts of firefighters and

        homes, natural resources, and rural economies throughout the 
        United States;
            (2) encourages the people and Government of the United 
        States to express their appreciation to the brave men and women 
        in the firefighting services throughout the United States;
            (3) encourages the people and communities of the United 
        States to act diligently in preventing and preparing for a 
        wildfire; and
            (4) encourages the people of the United States to keep in 
        their thoughts the individuals who have suffered as a result of 
        a wildfire.
