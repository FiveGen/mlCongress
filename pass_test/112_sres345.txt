                               RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing the sense of the Senate on the closure of Umatilla Army 
                        Chemical Depot, Oregon.

Whereas, in December 2001, the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal 
        year 2002 (Public Law 107-107) was signed into law, which included 
        authorization for a 2005 round of defense base closure and realignment 
        (BRAC);
Whereas, on February 16, 2004, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld included the 
        closure of the Umatilla Army Chemical Depot, Oregon, as one of his 
        recommendations for the 2005 round of defense base closure and 
        realignment;
Whereas, on September 8, 2005, the Defense Base Closure and Realignment 
        Commission, in its report making recommendations to the President, found 
        that Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld's assertion that the chemical 
        demilitarization mission at Umatilla would be complete by the 2nd 
        quarter of 2011 was optimistic, and wrote, ``An examination of status 
        information for the depot's mission completion and subsequent closure 
        revealed that dates may slip beyond the 6-year statutory period for 
        completion of BRAC actions.'';
Whereas, in that same report, the Defense Base Closure and Realignment 
        Commission took the Secretary of Defense's recommendation ``Close 
        Umatilla Chemical Depot, OR'' and changed it to ``On completion of the 
        chemical demilitarization mission in accordance with treaty obligations, 
        close Umatilla Chemical Depot, OR'';
Whereas, by doing so, the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission 
        acknowledged that the closure of Umatilla Army Chemical Depot would 
        happen when the demilitarization mission is completed, even if that is 
        after September 15, 2011; and
Whereas Congress did not pass a joint resolution of disapproval with respect to 
        the Commission's report, and the report and recommendations became law: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That, in light of the clear history, the Senate 
reiterates its original intent and reaffirms its direction that the 
closure of the Umatilla Army Chemical Depot, Oregon, and subsequent 
management and disposal shall be carried out in accordance with 
procedures and authorities contained in the Defense Base Closure and 
Realignment Act of 1990 (part A of title XXIX of Public Law 101-510; 10 
U.S.C. 2687 note).
                                 <all>
