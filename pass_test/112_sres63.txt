                               RESOLUTION


 
    Designating the first week of April 2011 as ``National Asbestos 
                           Awareness Week''.

Whereas dangerous asbestos fibers are invisible and cannot be smelled or tasted;
Whereas the inhalation of airborne asbestos fibers can cause significant damage;
Whereas asbestos fibers can cause cancer such as mesothelioma, asbestosis, and 
        other health problems;
Whereas asbestos-related diseases can take 10 to 50 years to present themselves;
Whereas the expected survival time for those diagnosed with mesothelioma is 
        between 6 and 24 months;
Whereas generally, little is known about late-stage treatment of asbestos-
        related diseases, and there is no cure for such diseases;
Whereas early detection of asbestos-related diseases may give some patients 
        increased treatment options and might improve their prognoses;
Whereas the United States has reduced its consumption of asbestos substantially, 
        yet continues to consume almost 820 metric tons of the fibrous mineral 
        for use in certain products throughout the Nation;
Whereas asbestos-related diseases have killed thousands of people in the United 
        States;
Whereas exposure to asbestos continues, but safety and prevention of asbestos 
        exposure already has significantly reduced the incidence of asbestos-
        related diseases and can further reduce the incidence of such diseases;
Whereas asbestos has been a cause of occupational cancer;
Whereas thousands of workers in the United States face significant asbestos 
        exposure;
Whereas thousands of people in the United States die from asbestos-related 
        diseases every year;
Whereas a significant percentage of all asbestos-related disease victims were 
        exposed to asbestos on naval ships and in shipyards;
Whereas asbestos was used in the construction of a significant number of office 
        buildings and public facilities built before 1975;
Whereas people in the small community of Libby, Montana, have asbestos-related 
        diseases at a significantly higher rate than the national average and 
        suffer from mesothelioma at a significantly higher rate than the 
        national average; and
Whereas the establishment of a ``National Asbestos Awareness Week'' will raise 
        public awareness about the prevalence of asbestos-related diseases and 
        the dangers of asbestos exposure: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates the first week of April 2011 as ``National 
        Asbestos Awareness Week'';
            (2) urges the Surgeon General to warn and educate people 
        about the public health issue of asbestos exposure, which may 
        be hazardous to their health; and
            (3) respectfully requests that the Secretary of the Senate 
        transmit a copy of this resolution to the Office of the Surgeon 
        General.
                                 <all>
