                               RESOLUTION


 
  Designating September 2011 as National Spinal Cord Injury Awareness 
                                 Month.

Whereas the estimated 1,275,000 people in the United States who live with a 
        spinal cord injury cost society billions of dollars in health care costs 
        and lost wages;
Whereas an estimated 100,000 of those individuals living with a spinal cord 
        injury are veterans who suffered the spinal cord injury while serving as 
        members of the United States Armed Forces;
Whereas accidents are the leading cause of spinal cord injuries;
Whereas motor vehicle crashes are the second leading cause of spinal cord and 
        traumatic brain injuries;
Whereas 70 percent of all spinal cord injuries that occur in children under the 
        age of 18 are a result of motor vehicle accidents;
Whereas every 48 seconds a person will become paralyzed, underscoring the urgent 
        need to develop new neuroprotection, pharmacological, and regeneration 
        treatments to reduce, prevent, and reverse paralysis; and
Whereas increased education and investment in research are key factors in 
        improving outcomes for victims of spinal cord injuries, improving the 
        quality of life of victims, and ultimately curing paralysis: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates September 2011 as Spinal Cord Injury 
        Awareness Month;
            (2) supports the goals and ideals of Spinal Cord Injury 
        Awareness Month;
            (3) continues to support research to find better 
        treatments, therapies, and a cure for paralysis;
            (4) supports clinical trials for new therapies that offer 
        promise and hope to those persons living with paralysis; and
            (5) commends the dedication of local, regional, and 
        national organizations, researchers, doctors, volunteers, and 
        people across the United States that are working to improve the 
        quality of life of persons living with paralysis and their 
        families.
                                 <all>
