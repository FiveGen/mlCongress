Designating the week beginning November 26, 2012, as ``National Tribal 
                   Colleges and Universities Week''.

Whereas there are 37 tribal colleges and universities operating on more than 75 
        campuses in 15 States;
Whereas tribal colleges and universities are tribally or federally chartered 
        institutions of higher education and therefore have a unique 
        relationship with the Federal Government;
Whereas tribal colleges and universities serve students from more than 250 
        federally recognized Indian tribes;
Whereas tribal colleges and universities offer students access to knowledge and 
        skills grounded in cultural traditions and values, including indigenous 
        languages, which enhance Indian communities and enrich the United States 
        as a whole;
Whereas tribal colleges and universities provide access to high quality higher 
        education opportunities for American Indians/Alaska Natives, and other 
        individuals living in some of the most rural and economically depressed 
        areas in the United States;
Whereas tribal colleges and universities are accredited institutions of higher 
        education that effectively prepare students to succeed in a global and 
        highly competitive workforce;
Whereas tribal colleges and universities have open enrollment policies that have 
        resulted in 17 percent of students at tribal colleges and universities 
        being non-Indians;
Whereas tribal colleges and universities are simply and effectively providing 
        access to quality higher education opportunities to residents of 
        reservation communities and the North Slope;
Whereas the American Indian Higher Education Consortium, the national 
        organization established in 1973 by tribal colleges and universities, 
        will be celebrating its 40th anniversary as the collective spirit and 
        unifying voice of tribal colleges and universities of the United States; 
        and
Whereas the mission and achievements of tribal colleges and universities deserve 
        national recognition: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates the week beginning November 26, 2012, as 
        ``National Tribal Colleges and Universities Week''; and
            (2) calls on the people of the United States and interested 
        groups to observe the week with appropriate ceremonies, 
        activities, and programs to demonstrate support for tribal 
        colleges and universities.
                                 <all>
