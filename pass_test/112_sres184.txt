                               RESOLUTION


 
 Recognizing the life and service of the Honorable Hubert H. Humphrey, 
  distinguished former Senator from the State of Minnesota and former 
Vice President of the United States, upon the 100th anniversary of his 
                                 birth.

Whereas Hubert H. Humphrey was born in Wallace, South Dakota, on May 27, 1911;
Whereas Hubert Humphrey, from his early years, recognized the importance of 
        public service by becoming a registered pharmacist and serving his 
        friends and neighbors in the Humphrey Drug Store in Huron, South Dakota, 
        from 1933 to 1937;
Whereas Hubert Humphrey received a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science 
        from the University of Minnesota in 1939 and a Masters of Arts degree 
        from Louisiana State University in 1940, subsequently teaching political 
        science at Macalester College from 1943 to 1944 and at Macalester 
        College and the University of Minnesota from 1969 to 1970;
Whereas Hubert Humphrey served in a variety of leadership positions in Minnesota 
        during World War II, dealing with war production, employment, and 
        manpower;
Whereas Hubert Humphrey served as Mayor of Minneapolis from 1945 to 1948, and 
        during his tenure as mayor, he drove organized crime from the city and, 
        among other achievements, created the Nation's first municipal equal 
        employment opportunity commission;
Whereas Hubert Humphrey was a driving force behind the creation of the 
        Democratic Farmer-Labor Party in Minnesota and was a founding member of 
        Americans for Democratic Action in the aftermath of World War II;
Whereas Hubert Humphrey led forces at the 1948 Democratic National Convention in 
        Philadelphia in support of the minority platform plank on civil rights 
        and equal opportunity, challenging the delegates to ``walk out of the 
        shadow of States' rights into the bright sunshine of human rights,'' 
        resulting in the convention's adoption of the minority plank;
Whereas in 1948, Hubert Humphrey became the first Democrat from Minnesota 
        elected to the Senate;
Whereas during his total 23 years of service in the Senate (including service 
        from 1949 to 1964 and service from 1970 to 1978), Hubert Humphrey 
        compiled a record of accomplishment virtually unmatched in the 20th 
        century, encompassing, among other issues, civil and human rights, 
        workforce development, labor rights, health care, arms control and 
        disarmament, the Peace Corps, small business assistance, education 
        reform, wilderness preservation, immigration reform, and agriculture;
Whereas his service as floor leader during the Senate's consideration of the 
        Civil Rights Act of 1964 was essential to the eventual passage of the 
        Act in the aftermath of breaking the filibuster against this historic 
        legislation;
Whereas Hubert Humphrey, although a dedicated leader of the Democratic Party, 
        always sought bipartisan support for his legislative goals and routinely 
        shared credit with other Senators for his legislative victories;
Whereas Hubert Humphrey, as Vice President of the United States, loyally served 
        President Lyndon Baines Johnson and successfully carried out a number of 
        domestic and overseas assignments;
Whereas Hubert Humphrey, as the Democratic Party's nominee for President of the 
        United States in 1968, waged one of the most courageous and hard-fought 
        campaigns in the history of the United States, losing to Richard Nixon 
        by less than 1 percentage point of the popular vote when he started the 
        campaign some 15 points behind;
Whereas Hubert Humphrey was reelected by the people of Minnesota (in 1970 and 
        1976) to 2 additional terms in the Senate, thereby continuing his 
        extraordinary record of legislative achievement with passage of such 
        bills as the Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment Act;
Whereas Hubert Humphrey, terminally ill with cancer, pursued his active public 
        life with great courage, fortitude, and good humor, and in the memorable 
        words of Vice President Walter F. Mondale at Hubert Humphrey's memorial 
        observance in the rotunda of the United States Capitol, ``Hubert 
        Humphrey taught us how to live and he taught us how to die''; and
Whereas the life and service of Hubert Humphrey were posthumously honored by 
        Congress with the presentation of the Congressional Gold Medal, and by 
        the President of the United States with the award of the Medal of 
        Freedom: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) honors the life, achievements, and distinguished career 
        of Senator and Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey upon the 
        occasion of his 100th birthday;
            (2) recognizes that Hubert H. Humphrey's legislative 
        achievements helped resolve many of this Nation's most 
        polarizing issues, such as civil rights, equal opportunity, and 
        nuclear arms control.
