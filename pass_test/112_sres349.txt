                               RESOLUTION


 
Commemorating and honoring the service and sacrifice of members of the 
 United States Armed Forces and their families as the official combat 
                   mission in Iraq draws to a close.

Whereas nearly 1,500,000 members of the United States Armed Forces served in 
        Iraq, many serving on multiple deployments;
Whereas the members of the United States Armed Forces who served in support of 
        operations in Iraq performed brilliantly in a highly complex and 
        challenging environment, and did everything that was asked of them and 
        more to meet the requirements of the mission;
Whereas thousands of members of the National Guard and Reserves left their 
        civilian jobs and livelihoods to support operations in Iraq, making 
        enormous contributions, and serving with distinction;
Whereas nearly 4,500 members of the United States Armed Forces made the ultimate 
        sacrifice in giving their lives in support of operations in Iraq;
Whereas more than 30,000 members of the United States Armed Forces were wounded 
        serving in support of operations in Iraq;
Whereas families of the members of the United States Armed Forces serving in 
        Iraq endured repeated deployments and spent many holidays, birthdays, 
        and anniversaries apart;
Whereas, after nearly nine years of combat, we welcome home our veterans and 
        continue to support members of the United States Armed Forces deployed 
        in Afghanistan and elsewhere in the world;
Whereas Iraq's destiny and future development now lie with its people; and
Whereas the people of the United States recognize the service and sacrifices 
        made by those members of the United States Armed Forces and veterans, as 
        well as their families: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) pays tribute to the members of the United States Armed 
        Forces who served in support of operations in Iraq;
            (2) calls on the people of the United States to reflect on 
        the service of those members of the United States Armed Forces, 
        veterans, and their families, and honor their sacrifices; and
            (3) commemorates and honors the contributions made by 
        members of the United States Armed Forces and their families, 
        as the official combat mission in Iraq draws to a close.
                                 <all>
