     Congratulating the Navy Dental Corps on its 100th anniversary.

Whereas on August 22, 1912, Congress passed an Act recognizing Navy dentistry as 
        a distinct branch among naval medical professions;
Whereas in the last century, the Navy Dental Corps has supported the Navy by 
        sustaining Sailor and Marine readiness and providing routine and 
        emergency dental care, ashore and afloat, in peace and in war;
Whereas the Navy Dental Corps works continuously to improve the health of 
        Sailors, Marines, and their families by supporting individual and 
        community prevention initiatives, good oral hygiene practices, and 
        treatment;
Whereas the Navy Dental Corps endeavors to improve oral health worldwide by 
        participating in the spectrum of military combat, peacekeeping, and 
        humanitarian operations and exercises;
Whereas the Navy Dental Corps, in collaboration with national and international 
        dental organizations, promotes dental professionalism and quality of 
        care;
Whereas the Navy Dental Corps supports the mission of the Federal dental 
        research program and endorses improved dental technologies and therapies 
        through research and adherence to sound scientific principles; and
Whereas the Navy Dental Corps recognizes the importance of continuing 
        professional dental education, requiring and supporting specialty dental 
        education and postgraduate residencies and fellowships for its members: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) congratulates the Navy Dental Corps on its 100th 
        anniversary;
            (2) commends the Navy Dental Corps for working to sustain 
        the dental readiness and the oral health of a superb fighting 
        force; and
            (3) recognizes the thousands of dentists who have served in 
        the Navy Dental Corps over the last 100 years, providing dental 
        care to millions of members of the Armed Forces and their 
        families.
