                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION

Whereas, on July 20, 2012, an armed gunman opened fire at a movie theater in 
        Aurora, Colorado, killing 12 and wounding 58 others;
Whereas many individuals at the theater selflessly sought to aid and protect 
        others above their own safety;
Whereas the Aurora Police Department and the Aurora Fire Department quickly and 
        bravely acted to prevent the additional loss of life; and
Whereas local, State, and Federal law enforcement, firefighter, and medical 
        service professionals performed their duties with utmost skill and 
        coordination: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That Congress--
            (1) condemns, in the strongest possible terms, the heinous 
        atrocities that occurred in Aurora, Colorado;
            (2) offers its condolences to the families, friends, and 
        loved ones of those who were killed in the attack and expresses 
        its hope for the rapid and complete recovery of the wounded;
            (3) applauds the hard work and dedication exhibited by the 
        hundreds of local, State, and Federal officials and the others 
        who offered their support and assistance; and
            (4) honors the resilience of the community of the City of 
        Aurora and the State of Colorado in the face of such adversity.

            Passed the House of Representatives July 26, 2012.

            Attest:
