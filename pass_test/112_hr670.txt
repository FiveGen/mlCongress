 To convey certain submerged lands to the Commonwealth of the Northern

              THE NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS.

    (a) In General.--The first section of Public Law 93-435 (48 U.S.C. 
1705) is amended by inserting ``the Commonwealth of the Northern 
Mariana Islands,'' after ``Guam,'' each place it appears.
    (b) References to Date of Enactment.--For the purposes of the 
amendment made by subsection (a), each reference in Public Law 93-435 
(48 U.S.C. 1705) to the ``date of enactment'' shall be considered to be 
a reference to the date of the enactment of this section.

            Passed the House of Representatives October 3, 2011.

            Attest:

                                                 KAREN L. HAAS,
