    Subsection (g) of section 8127 of title 38, United States Code, is 
amended--
            (1) by striking ``Any business'' and inserting ``(1) Any 
        business'';
            (2) by striking ``a reasonable period of time, as 
        determined by the Secretary'' and inserting ``a period of not 
        less than five years''; and
            (3) by adding at the end the following new paragraphs:
    ``(2) In the case of a debarment under paragraph (1), the Secretary 
shall commence debarment action against the business concern by not 
later than 30 days after determining that the concern misrepresented 
the status of the concern as described in paragraph (1) and shall 
complete debarment actions against such concern by not later than 90 
days after such determination.
    ``(3) The debarment of a business concern under paragraph (1) 
includes the debarment of all principals in the business concern for a
