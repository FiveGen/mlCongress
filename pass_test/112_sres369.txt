                               RESOLUTION


 
    Congratulating the New York Giants for winning Super Bowl XLVI.

Whereas on February 5, 2012, the New York Giants achieved the improbable and 
        upset the New England Patriots by a score of 21 to 17 to win Super Bowl 
        XLVI;
Whereas during the 2012 postseason, the Giants were the epitome of 
        determination, fortitude, and resiliency as they made their way through 
        the playoffs and ultimately triumphed over the New England Patriots;
Whereas quarterback Elisha Nelson ``Eli'' Manning, who went 30 for 40 for 296 
        yards, with 1 touchdown pass and zero interceptions, led a fourth-
        quarter touchdown drive, set a Super Bowl record by completing his first 
        9 pass attempts, and won his second Super Bowl Most Valuable Player 
        Award;
Whereas punter Steve Weatherford set a Super Bowl record with 3 punts downed 
        inside the 10-yard line;
Whereas in each round of the playoffs, when none of the experts thought the 
        Giants had a chance to win, the Giants and their loyal, dedicated, and 
        passionate fans believed they could accomplish what others declared 
        impossible;
Whereas in 2008, Tom Coughlin, head coach of the Giants, led the Giants to 
        victory in Super Bowl XLII;
Whereas this season, Tom Coughlin, in his eighth year as head coach of the 
        Giants, with the help of Perry Fewell, defensive coordinator, Kevin 
        Gilbride, offensive coordinator, and the entire Giants coaching staff, 
        led the Giants to a victory in Super Bowl XLVI and brought the Vince 
        Lombardi Trophy back to the Meadowlands;
Whereas the New York Giants organization is one of the most successful in 
        National Football League history, boasting 18 Hall of Famers, appearing 
        in 31 postseasons, winning more than 600 games and 8 championships, 
        including remarkable title runs in 1987, 1991, 2008, and 2012 (Super 
        Bowls XXI, XXV, XLII, and XLVI) that captivated New York and New Jersey;
Whereas the New York Giants are the first team to win the Super Bowl with a 9 
        and 7 regular-season record;
Whereas Giants co-owner and chief executive officer John Mara and chairman and 
        executive vice president Steve Tisch have done a remarkable job leading 
        this storied franchise with the assistance and dedication of their 
        talented staff;
Whereas the New York Giants have played all their home games in East Rutherford, 
        New Jersey since 1976 and have supported Bergen County and the northern 
        New Jersey and New York areas with community-outreach projects; and
Whereas the entire Giants franchise has become a model of professionalism, 
        teamwork, and community service in representing the entire New York and 
        New Jersey metropolitan area: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate congratulates the New York Giants for 
winning Super Bowl XLVI and completing one of the most impressive 
seasons in professional sports history.
