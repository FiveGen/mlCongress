                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
 Calling for universal condemnation of the North Korean missile launch 
                         of December 12, 2012.

Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolution 1695, unanimously adopted on 
        July 15, 2006, following a series of North Korean missile firings on 
        July 5, 2006, specifically condemned the Democratic People's Republic of 
        Korea's (North Korea) recent test-firing of a series of missiles, and 
        demanded that the

              

 North-East Asian country suspend all ballistic missile related activity 
and reinstate its moratorium on missile launches;

Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolution 1695 also required all Member 
        States, in accordance with their national legal authorities and 
        legislation and consistent with international law, to exercise vigilance 
        and prevent missile and missile-related items, materials, goods, and 
        technology being transferred to North Korea's missile or weapons of mass 
        destruction (WMD) programmes, and to prevent the procurement of missiles 
        or missile related-items, materials, goods, and technology from North 
        Korea, and the transfer of any financial resources in relation to North 
        Korea's missile or WMD programmes;
Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolution 1718, adopted on October 14, 
        2006, decided that North Korea shall suspend all activities related to 
        its ballistic missile programme and in this context re-establish its 
        pre-existing commitments to a moratorium on missile launching;
Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolution 1718 also imposed a ban on 
        the sales of military equipment and luxury goods to North Korea as well 
        as a ban on technology transfers;
Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolution 1718 further required Member 
        States to prevent the travel of North Korean officials connected to the 
        ballistic missile or nuclear programs, the inspection of cargo from 
        North Korea to assure it was not missile, WMD, or nuclear-related, and 
        the immediate freezing of funds, other financial assets, and economic 
        resources that support these illicit North Korean activities;
Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolution 1874, adopted on June 12, 
        2009, called upon Member States to inspect, seize, and dispose of 
        proscribed illicit North Korea items related to its missile, nuclear, 
        and WMD programmes and to prevent the provision of financial services or 
        the transfer to, through, or from their territory of any financial or 
        other assets or resources that could contribute to North Korea's 
        nuclear-related, ballistic missile-related, or other WMD-related 
        programmes or activities, and by denying fuel or supplies to service the 
        vessels carrying them;
Whereas, on December 12, 2012, in flagrant defiance of past United Nations 
        Security Council resolutions, the international community, and its Six-
        Party partners, North Korea launched a three-stage, long-range missile, 
        which overflew Japanese territory near Okinawa and dropped debris into 
        the Yellow Sea, the East China Sea, and waters adjacent to the 
        Philippines;
Whereas North Korea's latest provocative and defiant action represents a direct 
        threat to the United States Armed Forces in the Asia/Pacific region and 
        regional allies and friends, including Australia, Japan, the 
        Philippines, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan and is a 
        potential future threat to the United States and its people, including 
        those residing in Guam, Hawaii, Alaska, and the west coast of the United 
        States mainland; and
Whereas there has been extensive cooperation on missile development and military 
        cooperation between the Governments of North Korea and Iran that dates 
        back to the 1980s: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That it is the sense of the Congress that--
            (1) the North Korean missile launch of December 12, 2012, 
        represents a flagrant violation of United Nations Security 
        Council resolutions 825 (1993), 1540 (2004), 1695 (2006), 1718 
        (2006), and 1874 (2009), that North Korea continues to defy the 
        United Nations, its Six-Party partners, and the international 
        community, and that the Member States should immediately impose 
        sanctions covered by these resolutions and censure North Korea;
            (2) all current restrictions against the Government of 
        North Korea, including sanctions that ban the importation into 
        the United States of North Korean products and goods, should 
        remain in effect until the Government of North Korea no longer 
        engages in activities that threaten United States interests and 
        global peace and stability;
            (3) the Government of China should cooperate with the 
        United States in pursuit of a new round of United Nations 
        Security Council sanctions, to pressure its North Korean 
        partner, redouble its efforts to prevent Chinese companies from 
        transferring military and dual-use technologies to North Korea, 
        and to crack down on transshipments through China that relate 
        to North Korean military, missile, and nuclear programs and 
        proliferation activities; and
            (4) North Korea should abandon and dismantle its 
        provocative missile and nuclear weapons programs, cease its 
        proliferation activities, and come into immediate compliance 
        with all relevant international agreements and United Nations 
        Security Council resolutions.

            Passed the House of Representatives January 1, 2013.

            Attest:

                                                 KAREN L. HAAS,

                                                                 Clerk.
