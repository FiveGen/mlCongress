                             August 2, 2011

 Mr. Rockefeller (for himself, Mr. Alexander, and Mr. Levin) submitted

                               RESOLUTION


 
   Designating October 8, 2011, as ``National Chess Day'' to enhance 
 awareness and encourage students and adults to engage in a game known 
        to enhance critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

Whereas there are more than 76,000 members of the United States Chess Federation 
        (referred to in this preamble as the ``Federation''), and unknown 
        numbers of additional people in the United States who play the game 
        without joining an official organization;
Whereas approximately \1/2\ of the members of the Federation are scholastic 
        members, and many of the scholastic members join by the age of 10;
Whereas the Federation is very supportive of the scholastic programs and 
        sponsors a Certified Chess Coach program that provides the coaches 
        involved in the scholastic programs training and ensures schools and 
        students can have confidence in the programs;
Whereas many studies have linked chess programs to the improvement of student 
        scores in reading and math, as well as improved self-esteem;
Whereas the Federation offers a school curriculum to educators to help 
        incorporate chess into the school curriculum;
Whereas chess is a powerful cognitive learning tool that can be used to 
        successfully enhance reading and math concepts; and
Whereas chess engages students of all learning styles and strengths and promotes 
        problem-solving and higher-level thinking skills: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates October 8, 2011, as ``National Chess Day''; 
        and
            (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
        ``National Chess Day'' with appropriate programs and 
        activities.
                                 <all>
