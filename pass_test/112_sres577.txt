                               RESOLUTION


 
    Honoring the First Special Service Force, in recognition of its 
                 superior service during World War II.

Whereas the First Special Service Force (referred to in this preamble as the 
        ``Force''), a military unit composed of volunteers from the United 
        States and Canada, was activated in July 1942 at Fort Harrison near 
        Helena, Montana;
Whereas the Force was initially intended to target military and industrial 
        installations that were supporting the German war effort, including 
        important hydroelectric plants, which would severely limit the 
        production of strategic materials used by the Axis powers;
Whereas, from July 1942 through June 1943, volunteers of the Force trained in 
        hazardous, arctic conditions in the mountains of western Montana, and in 
        the waterways of Camp Bradford, Virginia;
Whereas the combat echelon of the Force totaled 1,800 soldiers, half from the 
        United States and half from Canada;
Whereas the Force also contained a service battalion, composed of 800 members 
        from the United States, that provided important support for the combat 
        troops;
Whereas a special bond developed between the Canadian and United States 
        soldiers, who were not segregated by country, although the commander of 
        the Force was a United States colonel;
Whereas the Force was the only unit formed during World War II that consisted of 
        troops from Canada and the United States;
Whereas, in October 1943, the Force went to Italy, where it fought in battles 
        south of Cassino, including Monte La Difensa and Monte Majo, two 
        mountain peaks that were a critical anchor of the German defense line;
Whereas, during the night of December 3, 1943, the Force ascended to the top of 
        the precipitous face of Monte La Difensa, where the Force suffered heavy 
        casualties and overcame fierce resistance to overtake the German line;
Whereas, after the battle for La Difensa, the Force continued to fight tough 
        battles at high altitudes, in rugged terrain, and in severe weather;
Whereas, after battles on the strongly defended Italian peaks of Sammucro, 
        Vischiataro, and Remetanea, the size of the Force had been reduced from 
        1,800 soldiers to fewer than 500;
Whereas, for 4 months in 1944, the Force engaged in raids and aggressive patrols 
        at the Anzio Beachhead;
Whereas, on June 4, 1944, members of the Force were among the first Allied 
        troops to liberate Rome;
Whereas, after liberating Rome, the Force moved to southern Italy and prepared 
        to assist in the liberation of France;
Whereas, during the early morning of August 15, 1944, members of the Force made 
        silent landings on Les Iles D'Hyeres, small islands in the Mediterranean 
        Sea along the southern coast of France;
Whereas the Force faced a sustained and withering assault from the German 
        garrisons as the Force progressed from the islands to the Franco-Italian 
        border;
Whereas, after the Allied forces secured the Franco-Italian border, the United 
        States Army ordered the disbandment of the Force on December 5, 1944, in 
        Nice, France;
Whereas, during 251 days of combat, the Force suffered 2,314 casualties, or 134 
        percent of its authorized strength, captured thousands of prisoners, won 
        5 United States campaign stars and 8 Canadian battle honors, and never 
        failed a mission;
Whereas the United States is forever indebted to the acts of bravery and 
        selflessness of the troops of the Force, who risked their lives for the 
        cause of freedom;
Whereas the efforts of the Force along the seas and skies of Europe were 
        critical in repelling the advance of Nazi Germany and liberating 
        numerous communities in France and Italy;
Whereas the bond between the members of the Force from the United States and 
        those from Canada has endured over the decades, as the members meet 
        every year for a reunion, alternating between the United States and 
        Canada; and
Whereas the traditions and honors exhibited by the Force are carried on by 2 
        outstanding active units of 2 great democracies, the Special Forces of 
        the United States and the Canadian Special Operations Regiment: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate recognizes and honors the superior 
service of the First Special Service Force during World War II.
                                 <all>
