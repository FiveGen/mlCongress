    Resolved, That upon the adoption of this resolution it shall be in order to 
take from the Speaker's table the bill (H.R. 8) to extend certain tax relief 
provisions enacted in 2001 and 2003, and to provide for expedited consideration 
of a bill providing for comprehensive tax reform, and for other purposes, with 
the Senate amendments thereto, and to consider in the House, without 
intervention of any point of order, a single motion offered by the chair of the 
Committee on Ways and Means or his designee that the House concur in the Senate 
amendments. The Senate amendments and the motion shall be considered as read. 
The motion shall be debatable for one hour equally divided and controlled by the

previous question shall be considered as ordered on the motion to its adoption 
without intervening motion or demand for division of the question.
            Attest:

                                                                          Clerk.
