                                 AN ACT


 
       To authorize the Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security 
     (Transportation Security Administration) to modify screening 
 requirements for checked baggage arriving from preclearance airports, 
                        and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``No-Hassle Flying Act of 2012''.

SEC. 2. PRECLEARANCE AIRPORTS.

    (a) In General.--Section 44901(d) of title 49, United States Code, 
is amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph:
            ``(4) Preclearance airports.--
                    ``(A) In general.--For a flight or flight segment 
                originating at an airport outside the United States and 
                traveling from an airport outside the United States 
                where U.S. Customs and Border Protection has 
                established preclearance operations, the Assistant 
                Secretary (Transportation Security Administration) may, 
                in coordination with U.S. Customs and Border 
                Protection, determine whether such baggage must be re-
                screened in the United States by an explosives 
                detection system before such baggage continues on any 
                additional flight or flight segment.
                    ``(B) Limitation.--The Assistant Secretary may not 
                exercise the authority under subparagraph (A) unless an 
                agreement is in effect between the United States and 
                the country from which the flight originates requiring 
                the implementation of security standards and protocols 
                that are determined by the Assistant Secretary in 
                coordination with U.S. Customs and Border Protection to 
                be comparable to those of the United States and 
                therefore sufficiently effective to enable passengers 
                to deplane into sterile areas of airports in the United 
                States.
                    ``(C) Report.--The Assistant Secretary shall submit 
                to the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of 
                Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security 
                and Governmental Affairs of the Senate an annual report 
                on the re-screening of baggage under this paragraph. 
                Each such report shall include the following for the 
                year covered by the report:
                            ``(i) A list of airports outside the United 
                        States from which a flight or flight segment 
                        traveled to the United States for which the 
                        Assistant Secretary determined, in accordance 
                        with the authority under subparagraph (A), that 
                        checked baggage was not required to be re-
                        screened in the United States by an explosive 
                        detection system before such baggage continued 
                        on an additional flight or flight segment.
                            ``(ii) The amount of Federal savings 
                        generated from the exercise of such 
                        authority.''.
    (b) Conforming Amendments.--Section 44901 of title 49, United 
States Code, is amended by striking ``explosive'' each place it appears 
and inserting ``explosives''.

            Passed the House of Representatives September 11, 2012.

            Attest:

                                                 KAREN L. HAAS,

                                                                 Clerk.
