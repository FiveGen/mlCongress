                               RESOLUTION


 
       Designating August 16, 2011, as ``National Airborne Day''.

Whereas the airborne forces of the Armed Forces have a long and honorable 
        history as bold and fierce warriors who, for the national security of 
        the United States and the defense of freedom and peace, project the 
        ground combat power of the United States by air transport to the far 
        reaches of the battle area and to the far corners of the world;
Whereas the United States' experiment with airborne operations began on June 25, 
        1940, when the Army Parachute Test Platoon was first authorized by the 
        Department of War, and 48 volunteers began training in July 1940;
Whereas August 16 marks the anniversary of the first official Army parachute 
        jump on August 16, 1940, to test the innovative concept of inserting 
        United States ground combat forces behind a battle line by means of a 
        parachute;
Whereas the success of the Army Parachute Test Platoon in the days immediately 
        before the entry of the United States into World War II validated the 
        airborne operational concept and led to the creation of a formidable 
        force of airborne formations, such as the 11th, 13th, 17th, 82nd, and 
        101st Airborne Divisions;
Whereas included in these divisions, and among other separate formations, were 
        many airborne combat, combat support, and combat service support units 
        that served with distinction and achieved repeated success in armed 
        hostilities that provide the lineage and legacy of many airborne units 
        throughout our Armed Forces;
Whereas the achievements of the airborne forces during World War II prompted the 
        evolution of those forces into a diversified force of parachute and air-
        assault units that, over the years, have fought in Korea, Vietnam, 
        Grenada, Panama, the Persian Gulf region, and Somalia, and have engaged 
        in peacekeeping operations in Lebanon, the Sinai Peninsula, the 
        Dominican Republic, Haiti, Bosnia, and Kosovo;
Whereas since the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, United States 
        airborne forces, which include members of the XVIII Airborne Corps, the 
        82nd Airborne Division, the 101st Airborne Division, the 173rd Airborne 
        Brigade Combat Team, the 4th Brigade Combat Team (Airborne) of the 25th 
        Infantry Division, the 75th Ranger Regiment, and special operations 
        forces of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, and Air Force, together with 
        other units of the Armed Forces, have demonstrated bravery and honor in 
        combat, stability, and training operations in Afghanistan and Iraq;
Whereas the modern-day airborne force also includes other elite forces composed 
        of airborne trained and qualified special operations warriors, including 
        Army Special Forces, Marine Corps Reconnaissance units, Navy SEALs, and 
        Air Force combat control and para-rescue teams;
Whereas of the members and former members of the United States airborne forces, 
        thousands have achieved the distinction of making combat jumps, dozens 
        have earned the Medal of Honor, and hundreds have earned the 
        Distinguished Service Cross, the Silver Star, or other decorations and 
        awards for displays of heroism, gallantry, intrepidity, and valor;
Whereas the members and former members of the United States airborne forces are 
        all members of a proud and honorable tradition that, together with their 
        special skills and achievements, distinguishes such members as intrepid 
        combat parachutists, air assault forces, special operation forces, and, 
        in former days, glider troops;
Whereas the history and achievements of the members and former members of the 
        United States airborne forces warrant special expressions of the 
        gratitude of the people of the United States; and
Whereas since the airborne forces, past and present, celebrate August 16 as the 
        anniversary of the first official jump by the Army Parachute Test 
        Platoon, August 16 is an appropriate day to recognize as National 
        Airborne Day: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates August 16, 2011, as ``National Airborne 
        Day''; and
            (2) calls on the people of the United States to observe 
        National Airborne Day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, 
        and activities.
                                 <all>
