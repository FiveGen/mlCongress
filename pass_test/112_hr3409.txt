                           GENERATING STATION

SEC. 701. LIMITATION ON AUTHORITY TO ISSUE REGULATIONS.

    The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall not 
promulgate any Federal implementation plan pursuant to section 169A or 
169B of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7491, 7492; relating to visibility 
protection) that would--
            (1) adversely impact employment at the coal-powered Navajo 
        Generating Station or other coal-fired power plants and coal 
        mines on tribal lands in northern Arizona;
            (2) directly or indirectly diminish the revenue received by 
        the Federal Government or any State, tribal or local government 
        by reducing through regulation the amount of coal that is 
        available for mining on Navajo and Hopi Reservation lands;
            (3) cause a reduction in coal-based revenue to meet 
        financial obligations required by federally authorized Indian 
        water rights settlements, pursuant to section 403(f) of the 
        Colorado River Basin Project Act (43 U.S.C. 1543(f)):
            (4) reduce the amount of coal, or increase the cost of 
        coal, available for the Navajo Generating Station's Federal 
        responsibility to deliver water and power, as authorized by the 
        Colorado River Basin Project Act (43 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.); or
            (5) expose the United States to liability for taking the 
        value of tribally-owned coal in northern Arizona through 
        regulation.
