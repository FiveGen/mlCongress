_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
      Designating September 2011 as ``Campus Fire Safety Month''.

Whereas, each year, States across the Nation formally designate September as 
        Campus Fire Safety Month;
Whereas, since January 2000, at least 143 people, including students, parents, 
        and children have died in campus-related fires;
Whereas 85 percent of those deaths occurred in off-campus residences;
Whereas a majority of college students in the United States live in off-campus 
        residences;
Whereas a number of fatal fires have occurred in buildings in which the fire 
        safety systems had been compromised or disabled by the occupants;
Whereas automatic fire alarm systems provide the early warning of a fire that is 
        necessary for occupants and the fire department to take appropriate 
        action;
Whereas automatic fire sprinkler systems are a highly effective method of 
        controlling or extinguishing a fire in its early stages, protecting the 
        lives of the building's occupants;
Whereas many college students live in off-campus residences, fraternity and 
        sorority housing, and residence halls that are not adequately protected 
        with automatic fire sprinkler systems and automatic fire alarm systems;
Whereas fire safety education is an effective method of reducing the occurrence 
        of fires and reducing the resulting loss of life and property damage;
Whereas college students do not routinely receive effective fire safety 
        education during their time in college;
Whereas it is vital to educate young people in the United States about the 
        importance of fire safety to help ensure fire-safe behavior by young 
        people during their college years and beyond; and
Whereas, by developing a generation of fire-safe adults, future loss of life 
        from fires may be significantly reduced: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates September 2011 as ``Campus Fire Safety 
        Month''; and
            (2) encourages administrators of institutions of higher 
        education and municipalities across the country--
                    (A) to provide educational programs to all students 
                during September and throughout the school year;
                    (B) to evaluate the level of fire safety being 
                provided in both on- and off-campus student housing; 
                and
                    (C) to ensure fire-safe living environments through 
                fire safety education, installation of fire suppression 
                and detection systems, and the development and 
                enforcement of applicable codes relating to fire 
                safety.
                                 <all>
