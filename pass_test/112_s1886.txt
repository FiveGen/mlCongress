SEC. 3. SENTENCING COMMISSION DIRECTIVE.

    (a) Directive to Sentencing Commission.--Pursuant to its authority 
under section 994(p) of title 28, United States Code, and in accordance 
with this section, the United States Sentencing Commission shall review 
and amend, if appropriate, its guidelines and its policy statements 
applicable to persons convicted of an offense described in section 
2320(b)(2) of title 18, United States Code, as amended by section 2, in 
order to reflect the intent of Congress that such penalties be 
increased in comparison to those currently provided by the guidelines 
and policy statements.
    (b) Requirements.--In carrying out this section, the Commission 
shall--
            (1) ensure that the sentencing guidelines and policy 
        statements reflect the intent of Congress that the guidelines 
        and policy statements reflect the serious nature of the 
        offenses described in subsection (a) and the need for an 
        effective deterrent and appropriate punishment to prevent such 
        offenses;
            (2) consider the extent to which the guidelines may or may 
        not appropriately account for the potential and actual harm to 
        the public resulting from the offense;
            (3) assure reasonable consistency with other relevant 
        directives and with other sentencing guidelines;
            (4) account for any additional aggravating or mitigating 
        circumstances that might justify exceptions to the generally 
        applicable sentencing ranges;
            (5) make any necessary conforming changes to the sentencing 
        guidelines; and
            (6) assure that the guidelines adequately meet the purposes 
        of sentencing as set forth in section 3553(a)(2) of title 18, 
        United States Code.

            Passed the Senate March 6, 2012.
