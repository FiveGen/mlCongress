 Congratulating the Pittsburg State University Gorillas football team 
      for winning the 2011 NCAA Division II Football Championship.

Whereas the Pittsburg State University Gorillas football team defeated the Wayne 
        State University Warriors by a score of 35 to 21 to win the 2011 NCAA 
        Division II Football Championship in Florence, Alabama on December 17, 
        2011;
Whereas Pittsburg State University has more all-time wins than any other NCAA 
        Division II football program and this championship victory, the 4th in 
        the history of the university, continues a long tradition of success;
Whereas the Pittsburg State University coaching staff, led by second-year Head 
        Coach Tim Beck, the 2011 Liberty Mutual Coach of the Year Award winner 
        for Division II, guided the Gorillas to a final regular season record of 
        13 wins and 1 loss;
Whereas the Gorillas benefitted from strong leadership in the championship game, 
        including senior quarterback and Pittsburg, Kansas native Zac Dickey, 
        who passed for 190 yards and rushed for 68 yards; and
Whereas the students, staff, alumni, and friends of Pittsburg State University, 
        along with the city of Pittsburg, Kansas, deserve much credit for 
        supporting the Gorillas football team: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) congratulates the Pittsburg State University Gorillas 
        football team for winning the 2011 NCAA Division II Football 
        Championship; and
            (2) recognizes the achievements of all the players, 
        coaches, and support staff of the Pittsburg State University 
        Gorillas football team.
