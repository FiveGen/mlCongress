Whereas the Combined Federal Campaign was established pursuant to Executive 
        Order 10927 (26 Fed. Reg. 2383) signed by President John F. Kennedy on 
        March 18, 1961;
Whereas the Combined Federal Campaign is the only authorized charitable 
        fundraising campaign for Federal employees, employees of the United 
        States Postal Service, and members of the armed forces;
Whereas the Combined Federal Campaign operates in more than 119 localities 
        throughout the United States, Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin 
        Islands, and overseas military installations;
Whereas more than 20,000 nonprofit charitable organizations participate annually 
        in the Combined Federal Campaign;
Whereas the men and women of the Federal Government, the United States Postal 
        Service, and the Armed Forces have contributed approximately 
        $7,000,000,000 to local, national, and international charities over the 
        past 50 years, making the Combined Federal Campaign the largest and most 
        successful workplace charitable drive in the world; and
Whereas commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Combined Federal Campaign will 
        thank public servants whose generous contributions over the years have 
        helped to feed hungry children, cure disease, comfort the sick and 
        dying, protect the environment and natural resources of the United 
        States, and offered hope to people and communities across the United 
        States and worldwide: Now, therefore, be it

        Federal Campaign;

        unyielding dedication, generosity, and spirit of charitable 
        giving;
            (3) calls upon the new generation of Federal employees, 
        employees of the United States Postal Service, and members of 
        the Armed Forces to participate annually in the Combined 
        Federal Campaign;
            (4) encourages all Federal employees, employees of the 
        United States Postal Service, and members of the Armed Forces 
        to continue their philanthropic efforts for the betterment of 
        the less fortunate; and
            (5) urges the people of the United States to observe the

        appropriate ceremonies and activities.
