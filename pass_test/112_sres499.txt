                               RESOLUTION


 
    Recognizing the tenth anniversary of the National Institute of 
                 Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering.

Whereas the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering 
        Establishment Act (Public Law 106-580; 114 Stat. 3088) was signed into 
        law on December 29, 2000;
Whereas the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering 
        (referred to in this preamble as the ``Institute'') awarded its first 
        research grants in April 2002;
Whereas the purpose of the Institute, a component of the National Institutes of 
        Health, is to conduct and support research, training, dissemination of 
        health information, and other programs relating to biomedical imaging, 
        biomedical engineering, and associated technologies and modalities with 
        biomedical applications;
Whereas the Institute was established to--

    (1) accelerate the development of new technologies with clinical and 
research applications;

    (2) improve coordination and efficiency at the National Institutes of 
Health and throughout the Federal Government;

    (3) lay the foundation for a new medical information age;

    (4) promote economic development; and

    (5) provide a structure for training current and future researchers 
based on the most recent innovative discoveries;

Whereas the Institute and the biomedical imaging and bioengineering research 
        communities encourage the integration of the physical and life sciences 
        to advance human health by improving quality of life and reducing the 
        burden of disease through research and discoveries;
Whereas, since its establishment, the Institute has supported research to 
        develop scientific advances in biotechnology, imaging, and biomedical 
        engineering, and to advance the application of biomedical technology to 
        improve detection, treatment, and prevention of disease by assembling 
        diverse teams of scientists and engineers to pursue innovative medical 
        therapies and technologies to better meet the health care needs of 
        patients; and
Whereas the Institute has helped to support scientific breakthroughs in areas 
        such as regenerative medicine, cancer treatments, and nanotechnology, 
        which are helping health care providers to better target care and meet 
        the individual health care needs of patients: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) commends the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging 
        and Bioengineering for its leadership in research and its role 
        in advancing technologies that improve patient health;
            (2) recognizes the remarkable impact that biomedical 
        research supported by the National Institute of Biomedical 
        Imaging and Bioengineering has had on patients; and
            (3) recognizes the importance of maintaining a strong 
        commitment to pursuing the next generation of life-saving 
        treatments and technologies for patients.
                                 <all>
