_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
Designating the week of August 6 through August 10, 2012, as ``National 
                     Convenient Care Clinic Week''.

Whereas convenient care clinics are health care facilities located in high-
        traffic retail outlets that provide affordable and accessible care to 
        patients who have little time to schedule an appointment with a 
        traditional primary care provider or are otherwise unable to schedule 
        such an appointment;
Whereas millions of people in the United States do not have a primary care 
        provider, and there is a worsening primary care provider shortage that 
        will prevent many people from obtaining one in the future;
Whereas convenient care clinics have provided an accessible alternative for more 
        than 15,000,000 people in the United States since the first clinic 
        opened in 2000, the number of convenient care clinics continues to 
        increase rapidly, and as of June 2012, there are approximately 1,350 
        convenient care clinics in 35 States;
Whereas convenient care clinics follow rigid industry-wide quality of care and 
        safety standards;
Whereas convenient care clinics are staffed by highly qualified health care 
        providers, including advanced practice nurses, physician assistants, and 
        physicians;
Whereas convenient care clinicians all have advanced education in providing 
        quality health care for common episodic ailments including cold and flu, 
        skin irritation, and muscle strains and sprains, and can also provide 
        immunizations, physicals, and preventive health screening;
Whereas convenient care clinics are proven to be a cost-effective alternative to 
        similar treatment obtained in physicians' offices, urgent care clinics, 
        or emergency departments; and
Whereas convenient care clinics complement traditional medical service providers 
        by providing extended weekday and weekend hours without the need for an 
        appointment, short wait times, and visits that generally last only 15 to 
        20 minutes: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates the week of August 6 through August 10, 
        2012, as ``National Convenient Care Clinic Week'';
            (2) supports the goals and ideals of National Convenient 
        Care Clinic Week to raise awareness of the need for accessible 
        and cost-effective health care options to complement the 
        traditional health care model;
            (3) recognizes that many people in the United States face 
        difficulties accessing traditional models of health care 
        delivery;
            (4) supports the use of convenient care clinics as an 
        adjunct to the traditional model of health care delivery; and
            (5) calls on the States to support the establishment of 
        convenient care clinics so that more people in the United 
        States will have access to the cost-effective and necessary 
        emergent and preventive services provided in the clinics.
