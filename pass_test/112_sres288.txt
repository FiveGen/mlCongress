                               RESOLUTION


 
Designating the week beginning October 9, 2011, as ``National Wildlife 
                             Refuge Week''.

Whereas in 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt established the first national 
        wildlife refuge on Florida's Pelican Island;
Whereas in 2011, the National Wildlife Refuge System, administered by the Fish 
        and Wildlife Service, is the premier system of lands and waters to 
        conserve wildlife in the world, and has grown to more than 150,000,000 
        acres, 553 national wildlife refuges, and 38 wetland management 
        districts in every State and territory of the United States;
Whereas national wildlife refuges are important recreational and tourism 
        destinations in communities across the Nation, and these protected lands 
        offer a variety of recreational opportunities, including 6 wildlife-
        dependent uses that the National Wildlife Refuge System manages: 
        hunting, fishing, wildlife observation, photography, environmental 
        education, and interpretation;
Whereas more than 370 units of the National Wildlife Refuge System have hunting 
        programs and more than 350 units of the National Wildlife Refuge System 
        have fishing programs, averaging more than 2,500,000 hunting visits and 
        more than 7,100,000 fishing visits;
Whereas the National Wildlife Refuge System experiences 28,200,000 wildlife 
        observation visits annually;
Whereas national wildlife refuges are important to local businesses and gateway 
        communities;
Whereas for every $1 appropriated, national wildlife refuges generate $4 in 
        economic activity;
Whereas the National Wildlife Refuge System experiences approximately 45,700,000 
        visits every year, generating nearly $1,700,000,000 and 27,000 jobs in 
        local economies;
Whereas the National Wildlife Refuge System encompasses every kind of ecosystem 
        in the United States, including temperate, tropical, and boreal forests, 
        wetlands, deserts, grasslands, arctic tundras, and remote islands, and 
        spans 12 time zones from the Virgin Islands to Guam;
Whereas national wildlife refuges are home to more than 700 species of birds, 
        220 species of mammals, 250 species of reptiles and amphibians, and more 
        than 1,000 species of fish;
Whereas national wildlife refuges are the primary Federal lands that foster 
        production, migration, and wintering habitat for waterfowl;
Whereas since 1934, more than $750,000,000 in funds, from the sale of the 
        Federal Duck Stamp to outdoor enthusiasts, has enabled the purchase or 
        lease of more than 5,300,000 acres of waterfowl habitat in the National 
        Wildlife Refuge System;
Whereas 59 refuges were established specifically to protect imperiled species, 
        and of the more than 1,300 federally listed threatened and endangered 
        species in the United States, 280 species are found on units of the 
        National Wildlife Refuge System;
Whereas national wildlife refuges are cores of conservation for larger 
        landscapes and resources for other agencies of the Federal Government 
        and State governments, private landowners, and organizations in their 
        efforts to secure the wildlife heritage of the United States;
Whereas 39,000 volunteers and more than 220 national wildlife refuge ``Friends'' 
        organizations contribute nearly 1,400,000 hours annually, the equivalent 
        of 665 full-time employees, and provide an important link with local 
        communities;
Whereas national wildlife refuges provide an important opportunity for children 
        to discover and gain a greater appreciation for the natural world;
Whereas because there are national wildlife refuges located in several urban and 
        suburban areas and 1 refuge located within an hour's drive of every 
        metropolitan area in the United States, national wildlife refuges 
        employ, educate, and engage young people from all backgrounds in 
        exploring, connecting with, and preserving the natural heritage of the 
        Nation;
Whereas since 1995, refuges across the Nation have held festivals, educational 
        programs, guided tours, and other events to celebrate National Wildlife 
        Refuge Week during the second full week of October;
Whereas the Fish and Wildlife Service will continue to seek stakeholder input on 
        the implementation of the recommendations in the document entitled 
        ``Conserving the Future: Wildlife Refuges and the Next Generation'', 
        which is an update to the strategic plan of the Fish and Wildlife 
        Service for the future of the National Wildlife Refuge System;
Whereas the week beginning on October 9, 2011, has been designated as ``National 
        Wildlife Refuge Week'' by the Fish and Wildlife Service;
Whereas in 2011, the designation of National Wildlife Refuge Week would 
        recognize more than a century of conservation in the United States and 
        would serve to raise awareness about the importance of wildlife and the 
        National Wildlife Refuge System and to celebrate the myriad recreational 
        opportunities available to enjoy this network of protected lands: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates the week beginning on October 9, 2011, as 
        ``National Wildlife Refuge Week'';
            (2) encourages the observance of National Wildlife Refuge 
        Week with appropriate events and activities;
            (3) acknowledges the importance of national wildlife 
        refuges for their recreational opportunities and contribution 
        to local economies across the United States;
            (4) pronounces that national wildlife refuges play a vital 
        role in securing the hunting and fishing heritage of the United 
        States for future generations;
            (5) identifies the significance of national wildlife 
        refuges in advancing the traditions of wildlife observation, 
        photography, environmental education, and interpretation;
            (6) recognizes the importance of national wildlife refuges 
        to wildlife conservation and the protection of imperiled 
        species and ecosystems, as well as compatible uses;
            (7) acknowledges the role of national wildlife refuges in 
        conserving waterfowl and waterfowl habitat pursuant to the 
        Migratory Bird Treaty Act (40 Stat. 755, chapter 128);
            (8) reaffirms the support of the Senate for wildlife 
        conservation and the National Wildlife Refuge System; and
            (9) expresses the intent of the Senate--
                    (A) to continue working to conserve wildlife; and
                    (B) to manage the National Wildlife Refuge System 
                for current and future generations.
                                 <all>
