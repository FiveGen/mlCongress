                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                             March 9, 2011

     Mr. Casey (for himself and Mr. Burr) submitted the following 
             resolution; which was considered and agreed to

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
   Affirming the importance of exercise and physical activity as key 
  components of a healthy lifestyle, including in combating obesity, 
       reducing chronic disease, and lowering health care costs.

Whereas data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicate that 
        poor diet and physical inactivity cause over 400,000 deaths each year;
Whereas data from the Department of Health and Human Services estimate that 68 
        percent of adults and 16.9 percent of children of the United States are 
        obese or overweight;
Whereas obesity is associated with more than 30 medical conditions, including 
        cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and hypertension;
Whereas research has clearly demonstrated that increased physical activity can 
        play a direct role in reducing the incidence of chronic diseases, 
        including heart disease and diabetes;
Whereas, given the most recent trends in obesity, 1 in 3 children born in the 
        United States in 2000 is expected to develop diabetes over the course of 
        his or her lifetime;
Whereas research has estimated that moderate aerobic exercise lowers the adult 
        risk for type 2 diabetes by 58 percent, heart disease by 45 percent, 
        colon cancer by up to 50 percent, and breast cancer by up to 30 percent;
Whereas average per capita health spending increased by 40 percent during 
        calendar years 1997 through 2005, but the average per capita spending 
        for the 15 costliest conditions, all associated with obesity, increased 
        55 percent during those calendar years;
Whereas the potential savings in direct medical costs if all inactive American 
        adults engaged in regular physical activity could be as high as 
        $80,000,000,000;
Whereas approximately half of the direct medical costs associated with diseases 
        that stem from obesity and inactivity are paid for by the government and 
        the taxpayers of the United States through federally funded programs, 
        such as Medicaid and Medicare;
Whereas regular exercise combined with reduced caloric intake has been shown to 
        be most effective in reducing body mass;
Whereas, even if an individual does not lose weight, exercise may provide health 
        benefits to that individual, including psychological benefits such as 
        lower rates of stress and anxiety, lower rates of depression, higher 
        self-esteem, and an improved body image; and
Whereas new research shows that financial incentives can be used to develop or 
        foster good exercise habits: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) affirms the importance of exercise and physical 
        activity as key components of a healthy lifestyle, including 
        combating obesity, reducing chronic disease, and lowering 
        health care costs; and
            (2) encourages the development of incentives, including 
        responsible economic incentives, to promote exercise and a more 
        physically active and healthy United States.
                                 <all>
