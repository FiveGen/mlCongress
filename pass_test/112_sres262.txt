                               RESOLUTION


 
  Designating the week beginning on September 12, 2011, and ending on 
September 16, 2011, as ``National Health Information Technology Week'' 
 to recognize the value of health information technology in improving 
                            health quality.

Whereas healthcare information technology and management systems have been 
        recognized as essential tools for improving patient care, ensuring 
        patient safety, stopping duplicative tests and paperwork, and reducing 
        health care costs;
Whereas the Center for Information Technology Leadership has estimated that the 
        implementation of national standards for interoperability and the 
        exchange of health information would save the United States 
        approximately $77,000,000,000 in expenses relating to healthcare each 
        year;
Whereas Congress has made a commitment to leveraging the benefits of healthcare 
        information technology and management systems, including supporting the 
        adoption of electronic health records that will help to reduce costs and 
        improve quality while ensuring the privacy of patients;
Whereas Congress has emphasized improving the quality and safety of delivery of 
        healthcare in the United States; and
Whereas since 2006, organizations across the United States have united to 
        support National Health Information Technology Week to improve public 
        awareness of the benefits of improved quality and cost efficiency of the 
        healthcare system that the implementation of health information 
        technology could achieve: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates the week beginning on September 12, 2011, 
        and ending on September 16, 2011, as ``National Health 
        Information Technology Week'';
            (2) recognizes the value of information technology and 
        management systems in transforming healthcare for the people of 
        the United States; and
            (3) calls on all interested parties to promote the use of 
        information technology and management systems to transform the 
        healthcare system of the United States.
                                 <all>
