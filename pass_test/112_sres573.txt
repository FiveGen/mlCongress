                               RESOLUTION


 
 Designating the third week of January 2013 as ``Teen Cancer Awareness 
                                Week''.

Whereas cancer among adolescents is rare, but is still the leading cause of 
        death from disease for teenagers between the ages of 15 and 19;
Whereas teenage cancer patients receive treatment at various types of medical 
        establishments, including pediatric hospitals, pediatric oncology 
        centers, and adult cancer facilities;
Whereas teenage cancer patients may feel out of place in any of these settings 
        if their clinical and psychosocial needs are not met;
Whereas 40 percent of cancer patients aged 14 and younger are enrolled in 
        clinical trials, compared with only 9 percent of cancer patients between 
        the ages of 15 and 24;
Whereas teenagers with cancer have unique concerns about their education, social 
        lives, body image, and infertility, among other concerns, and their 
        needs may be misunderstood or unacknowledged;
Whereas many adolescent cancer survivors have difficulty readjusting to school 
        and social settings, experience anxiety, and in some cases face 
        increased learning difficulties; and
Whereas it is important to understand the biological and clinical needs of 
        teenagers with cancer, seek the prevention of cancer in teenagers, and 
        increase awareness in the general public of the unique challenges facing 
        teenagers with cancer: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate designates the third week of January 2013 
as ``Teen Cancer Awareness Week'' to promote awareness of teenage 
cancer and the unique medical and social needs of teenagers with 
cancer.
