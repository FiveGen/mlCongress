                                 AN ACT


 
 To amend the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to require that each 5-
 year offshore oil and gas leasing program offer leasing in the areas 
    with the most prospective oil and gas resources, to establish a 
 domestic oil and natural gas production goal, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Reversing President Obama's Offshore 
Moratorium Act''.

SEC. 2. OUTER CONTINENTAL SHELF LEASING PROGRAM.

    Section 18(a) of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 
1344(a)) is amended by adding at the end the following:
            ``(5)(A) In each oil and gas leasing program under this 
        section, the Secretary shall make available for leasing and 
        conduct lease sales including--
                    ``(i) at least 50 percent of the available unleased 
                acreage within each outer Continental Shelf planning 
                area considered to have the largest undiscovered, 
                technically recoverable oil and gas resources (on a 
                total btu basis) based upon the most recent national 
                geologic assessment of the outer Continental Shelf, 
                with an emphasis on offering the most geologically 
                prospective parts of the planning area; and
                    ``(ii) any State subdivision of an outer 
                Continental Shelf planning area that the Governor of 
                the State that represents that subdivision requests be 
                made available for leasing.
            ``(B) In this paragraph the term `available unleased 
        acreage' means that portion of the outer Continental Shelf that 
        is not under lease at the time of a proposed lease sale, and 
        that has not otherwise been made unavailable for leasing by 
        law.
            ``(6)(A) In the 2012-2017 5-year oil and gas leasing 
        program, the Secretary shall make available for leasing any 
        outer Continental Shelf planning areas that--
                    ``(i) are estimated to contain more than 
                2,500,000,000 barrels of oil; or
                    ``(ii) are estimated to contain more than 
                7,500,000,000,000 cubic feet of natural gas.
            ``(B) To determine the planning areas described in 
        subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall use the document entitled 
        `Minerals Management Service Assessment of Undiscovered 
        Technically Recoverable Oil and Gas Resources of the Nation's 
        Outer Continental Shelf, 2006'.''.

SEC. 3. DOMESTIC OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION GOAL.

    Section 18(b) of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 
1344(b)) is amended to read as follows:
    ``(b) Domestic Oil and Natural Gas Production Goal.---
            ``(1) In general.--In developing a 5-year oil and gas 
        leasing program, and subject to paragraph (2), the Secretary 
        shall determine a domestic strategic production goal for the 
        development of oil and natural gas as a result of that program. 
        Such goal shall be--
                    ``(A) the best estimate of the possible increase in 
                domestic production of oil and natural gas from the 
                outer Continental Shelf;
                    ``(B) focused on meeting domestic demand for oil 
                and natural gas and reducing the dependence of the 
                United States on foreign energy; and
                    ``(C) focused on the production increases achieved 
                by the leasing program at the end of the 15-year period 
                beginning on the effective date of the program.
            ``(2) 2012-2017 program goal.--For purposes of the 2012-
        2017 5-year oil and gas leasing program, the production goal 
        referred to in paragraph (1) shall be an increase by 2027 of--
                    ``(A) no less than 3,000,000 barrels in the amount 
                of oil produced per day; and
                    ``(B) no less than 10,000,000,000 cubic feet in the 
                amount of natural gas produced per day.
            ``(3) Reporting.--The Secretary shall report annually, 
        beginning at the end of the 5-year period for which the program 
        applies, to the Committee on Natural Resources of the House of 
        Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural 
        Resources of the Senate on the progress of the program in 
        meeting the production goal. The Secretary shall identify in 
        the report projections for production and any problems with 
        leasing, permitting, or production that will prevent meeting 
        the goal.''.

            Passed the House of Representatives May 12, 2011.

            Attest:

                                                 KAREN L. HAAS,

                                                                 Clerk.
