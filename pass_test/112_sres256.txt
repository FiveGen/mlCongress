                               RESOLUTION


 
     Designating the week of October 2 through October 8, 2011, as 
             ``National Nurse-Managed Health Clinic Week''.

Whereas nurse-managed health clinics are nonprofit community-based health care 
        sites that offer primary care and wellness services based on the nursing 
        model;
Whereas the nursing model emphasizes the protection, promotion, and optimization 
        of health, the prevention of illness, the alleviation of suffering, and 
        the diagnosis and treatment of illness;
Whereas nurse-managed health clinics are led by advanced practice nurses and 
        staffed by an interdisciplinary team of highly qualified health care 
        professionals;
Whereas nurse-managed health clinics offer a broad scope of services including 
        treatment for acute and chronic illnesses, routine physical exams, 
        immunizations for adults and children, disease screenings, health 
        education, prenatal care, dental care, and drug and alcohol treatment;
Whereas nurse-managed health clinics have a proven track record, as the first 
        federally funded nurse-managed health clinic was created more than 35 
        years ago;
Whereas, as of June 2011, more than 250 nurse-managed health clinics provided 
        care across the United States and recorded more than 2,000,000 client 
        encounters annually;
Whereas nurse-managed health clinics serve a unique dual role as both health 
        care safety net access points and health workforce development sites, 
        given that the majority of nurse-managed health clinics are affiliated 
        with schools of nursing and serve as clinical education sites for 
        students entering the health profession;
Whereas nurse-managed health clinics strengthen the health care safety net by 
        expanding access to primary care and chronic disease management services 
        for vulnerable and medically underserved populations in diverse rural, 
        urban, and suburban communities;
Whereas research has shown that nurse-managed health clinics experience high-
        patient retention and patient satisfaction rates, and nurse-managed 
        health clinic patients experience higher rates of generic medication 
        fills and lower hospitalization rates when compared to similar safety 
        net providers; and
Whereas the use of nurse-managed health clinics offering both primary care and 
        wellness services will help meet this increased demand in a cost-
        effective manner: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates the week of October 2 through October 8, 
        2011, as ``National Nurse-Managed Health Clinic Week'';
            (2) supports the ideals and goals of National Nurse-Managed 
        Health Clinic Week; and
            (3) encourages the expansion of nurse-managed health 
        clinics so that nurse-managed health clinics may continue to 
        serve as health care workforce development sites for the next 
        generation of primary care providers.
