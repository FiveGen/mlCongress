                               RESOLUTION


 
Commending efforts to promote and enhance public safety on the need for 
           yellow corrugated stainless steel tubing bonding.

Whereas yellow corrugated stainless steel tubing (referred to in this preamble 
        as ``CSST'') is flexible gas piping used to convey natural gas or 
        propane to household appliances in homes and businesses;
Whereas since 1990, yellow CSST has been installed in more than 6,000,000 homes 
        and businesses in the United States;
Whereas field reports and research suggest that if direct or indirect lightning 
        strikes a structure, the risk for electrical arcing between the metal 
        components in a structure with yellow CSST may be reduced by means of 
        equipotential bonding and grounding;
Whereas proper bonding of CSST is defined in section 7.13.2 of the 2009 edition 
        of the NFPA 54: National Fuel Gas Code, and is referenced in info note 2 
        in section 250.104 of the 2011 edition of the NFPA 70: National Electric 
        Code;
Whereas the National Association of State Fire Marshals supports the proper 
        bonding of yellow CSST to current National Fire Protection Association 
        Code to reduce the possibility of gas leaks and fires from lightning 
        strikes;
Whereas the National Association of State Fire Marshals is working to educate 
        relevant stakeholders, including fire, building, and housing officials, 
        consumers, homeowners, and construction professionals about the need to 
        properly bond yellow CSST in legacy installations and in all new 
        installations in accordance with the most recent building codes and 
        manufacturer installation instructions;
Whereas the bonding of yellow CSST in legacy installations is an important 
        public safety matter that merits alerting homeowners, relevant State and 
        local fire, building, and housing officials, and construction 
        professionals such as electricians, contractors, plumbers, inspectors, 
        and home-improvement specialists: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) commends efforts to promote and enhance public safety 
        and consumer awareness on proper bonding of yellow corrugated 
        stainless steel tubing (referred to in this resolution as 
        ``CSST'') as defined in the National Fire Protection 
        Association Code; and
            (2) encourages further educational efforts for the public, 
        relevant building and housing officials, consumers, homeowners, 
        and construction professionals on the need to properly bond 
        yellow CSST retroactively and moving forward in houses that 
        contain the product.
                                 <all>
