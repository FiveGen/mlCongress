                               RESOLUTION


 
 Commending Girl Scouts of the USA on the special occasion of its 52nd 
 annual convention and commending the commitment of Girl Scouts of the 
USA to the mission of fostering the courage, confidence, and character 
  that girls need to become leaders and make the world a better place.

Whereas, on March 12, 1912, founder Juliette Gordon Low organized the first 
        troop of Girl Scouts of the USA (referred to in this preamble as ``Girl 
        Scouts'');
Whereas, on March 16, 1950, Girl Scouts became the first national organization 
        for girls to be granted a Federal charter by Congress;
Whereas Girl Scouts regularly informs Congress of its progress and program 
        initiatives through annual reports;
Whereas Girl Scouts actively promotes initiatives to help young women discover 
        their full potential by--

    (1) instilling a sound foundation of positive values;

    (2) developing a sense of service;

    (3) facilitating creative decision-making; and

    (4) turning girls into model citizens and leaders of their community, 
the country, and the world;

Whereas Girl Scouts is holding its 52nd Convention in November 2011 in Houston, 
        Texas;
Whereas the 2011 Girl Scout Leadership Institute, which will run at the 52nd 
        Convention, encourages young women, ages 13 to 18, to explore and build 
        skills in math, science, business, and technology to prepare for future 
        success in the increasingly competitive global marketplace;
Whereas the 2011 Girl Scout Leadership Institute, under the theme of 
        ``Leadership and Innovation, the Next 100 Years''--

    (1) seeks to advance leadership opportunities for girls;

    (2) promotes programs that offer advanced curriculum;

    (3) engages over 1,200 young women from across the globe;

    (4) connects young women to industry professionals;

    (5) builds the interest of young women in innovation and technology;

    (6) addresses global issues; and

    (7) teaches life-long leadership abilities and teamwork skills in an 
interactive environment;

Whereas Girl Scouts has renewed the focus on involving girls in ``innovative, 
        hands-on experiences in science, technology, engineering, and math'' 
        (referred to in this preamble as ``STEM'') that ``strengthen the natural 
        aptitudes of girls and acquaint them with new career options and tools 
        for future independence'';
Whereas Girl Scouts develops girl-centered programs that--

    (1) are attuned to the ever-changing needs of women working in the 
current global market; and

    (2) encourage girls to actively engage in STEM activities, facilitating 
valuable real-world experiences that are integral to developing the next 
female leaders of the United States;

Whereas Girl Scouts remains a preeminent organization with 3,200,000 members, 
        dedicated solely to--

    (1) inspiring generations of girls to reach for their goals, challenge 
stereotypes, and develop to their full potential; and

    (2) advancing opportunities for women to accomplish feats previously 
thought impossible for the female gender; and

Whereas Girl Scouts has significantly contributed to the advancement of the 
        United States for 100 years by instilling in young women the leadership 
        qualities on which the strength of the United States depends: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) commends Girl Scouts of the USA for organizing--
                    (A) the 2011 National Council Session and the 52nd 
                Convention;
                    (B) the 2011 Girl Scout Leadership Institute; and
                    (C) the 2011 ``Leadership and Innovation, the Next 
                100 Years'' workshops; and
            (2) commends Girl Scouts of the USA for continuing to 
        create learning opportunities and activities for young women to 
        develop strong leadership values and life skills.
