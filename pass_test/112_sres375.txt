Celebrating the bicentennial of the City of Columbus, the capital city 
                         of the State of Ohio.

Whereas in 1787, Congress enacted the Northwest Ordinance to settle claims

Whereas in 1812, the Ohio General Assembly was offered land along the Scioto 
        River in Central Ohio to serve as the capital of the State, due to its 
        central location;
Whereas on February 14, 1812, the Ohio General Assembly officially designated 
        the new capital city as Columbus, in honor of Christopher Columbus;
Whereas Columbus emerged as a trading and transportation hub through the 
        influence of the Ohio & Erie Canal and the National Highway;
Whereas on March 3, 1834, 31 years after Ohio achieved statehood, Columbus was 
        officially chartered as a city because of its growing population;

        the Union Army that housed 26,000 troops, Camp Jackson, an assembly 
        center for recruits, and Columbus Barracks, which served as an arsenal;
Whereas Columbus was a major outpost on the Underground Railroad, led by the 
        Kelton family, who assisted fugitive slaves on their road to freedom;
Whereas in 1870, the Ohio General Assembly used to the Morrill Land Grant Act to 
        create the Ohio Agricultural and Mechanical College, which was renamed

        premier public universities and an anchor for economic activity in the 
        City of Columbus;
Whereas Columbus is home to other world-class institutions of higher learning, 
        including Capital University, established in 1830, Columbus College of

        living with disabilities, having established the Ohio School for the 
        Deaf in 1829 and the Ohio State School for the Blind in 1837;
Whereas Columbus is of historical importance to the organized labor movement, as 
        one of the Nation's first federations of labor, the American Federation 
        of Labor, was founded in Columbus in 1886;
Whereas the American Veterans of Foreign Service, the earliest organization of 
        veterans of foreign wars, was founded in Columbus in 1899;

        the rise of manufacturing and steel businesses, brewers, and cultural 
        and arts institutions, such as the Southern Theatre;
Whereas leading retail corporations, health care and insurance companies, and 
        financial institutions call Columbus their home, attracted by the city's 
        world-class workforce and cultural outlets;
Whereas Columbus serves as a leader in cutting-edge medical research and 
        hospital systems through the Ohio State Medical Center and the Arthur 
        James Cancer Hospital and Richard J. Solove Research Institute, 
        Nationwide Children's Hospital, Mt. Carmel Hospital, Riverside Community 
        Hospital, and Grant Medical Center;
Whereas Columbus is home to green space and parks that are used as both 
        community gathering locations and to honor pioneers, including Shrum

        States, which dates back more than 2,000 years;
Whereas Columbus is also home to the Midwest's largest Fourth of July Festival

        Eastern United States;
Whereas February 14, 2012, marks the 200\th\ anniversary of the founding of 
        Columbus, Ohio; and
Whereas the citizens of Columbus will commemorate a year-long bicentennial 
        celebration with the theme of ``Honor the Past. Celebrate the Present.

    Resolved, That the Senate--

        of the City of Columbus, the capital of the State of Ohio; and
