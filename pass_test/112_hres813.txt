H. Res. 813

                In the House of Representatives, U. S.,

                                                     November 16, 2012.
Whereas Hamas was founded with the stated goal of destroying the State of 
        Israel;
Whereas Hamas has been designated by the Secretary of State as a Foreign 
        Terrorist Organization;
Whereas Hamas refuses to recognize Israel's right to exist, renounce violence, 
        and accept previous agreements between Israel and the Palestinians;
Whereas Hamas has launched thousands of rockets and missiles since Israel 
        dismantled settlements and withdrew from Gaza in 2005;
Whereas terrorists in the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip have fired approximately 
        900 rockets and missile shells into Israel this year, an increase from 
        roughly 675 attacks in 2011 and 350 in 2010;
Whereas Hamas has increased the range of its rockets, reportedly with support 
        from Iran and others, putting additional large numbers of Israelis in 
        danger of rocket attacks from Gaza;
Whereas, on November 14, 2012, President Barack Obama condemned the rocket fire 
        from Gaza into Israel and reiterated Israel's right to self-defense; and
Whereas Israel, a fellow democracy, has an inherent right to self defense in the 
        face of terrorist attacks: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) expresses unwavering commitment to the security of the State of 
        Israel as a Jewish and democratic state with secure borders, and 
        recognizes and strongly supports its inherent right to act in self-
        defense to protect its citizens against acts of terrorism;
            (2) reiterates that Hamas must end Gaza-linked terrorist rocket and 
        missile attacks against Israel, recognize Israel's right to exist, 
        renounce violence, and agree to accept previous agreements between 
        Israel and the Palestinians;
            (3) urges the United Nations Security Council to condemn the recent 
        spike in Gaza-linked terrorist missile attacks against Israel, which 
        risk causing civilian casualties in both Israel and Gaza; and
            (4) encourages the President to continue to work diplomatically with 
        the international community to prevent Hamas and other Gaza-based 
        terrorist organizations from retaining or rebuilding the capability to 
        launch rockets and missiles against Israel.
            Attest:

                                                                          Clerk.
