SEC. 2. AMENDMENT TO THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT.

    (a) In General.--Section 1905(b) of the Social Security Act (42 
U.S.C. 1396d(b)) is amended by adding at the end the following: 
``Notwithstanding the first sentence of this subsection, in the case of 
Alaska, the Federal medical assistance percentage shall be 100 per 
centum less that percentage which bears the same ratio to 45 per centum 
as the square of the adjusted per capita income of Alaska bears to the 
square of the per capita income of the 50 States. For purposes of the 
preceding sentence, the adjusted per capita income of Alaska shall be 
determined by dividing the 3-year average per capita income for Alaska 
by 1.25.''.
    (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) applies 
to fiscal year quarters beginning on and after the date of enactment of 
this Act.
