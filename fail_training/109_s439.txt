                forth in part 280 of title 40, Code of Federal 
                Regulations (or a successor regulation).
            ``(2) Installation and replacement.--On and after the 
        effective date of this subsection, any new underground storage 
        tank system that is installed, and any existing underground 
        storage tank system that is replaced, shall be secondarily 
        contained and space between the primary and secondary 
        containment of a new or replaced underground storage tank 
        system shall be monitored for leaks if the new or replaced 
        underground storage tank or piping is within 1,000 feet of--

            ``(3) Limitations.--
                    ``(A) In the case of the replacement of an existing 
                underground storage tank that is connected to other 
                underground storage tanks by piping, paragraph (2) 
                shall apply only to the underground storage tank being 
                replaced and not to such other underground storage 
                tanks.
                    ``(B) In the case of the replacement of existing 
                underground pipes connected to an underground storage 
                tank, paragraph (2) shall apply only to the underground 
                pipes and not to the underground storage tanks to which 
                the pipes are connected.

        enforce any regulation, requirement, or standard of performance 
        relating to secondary containment for underground storage tank 
        systems that are more stringent than requirements established 
        under this section.
