                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
Recognizing the sacrifices being made by the families of members of the 
   Armed Forces and supporting the designation of a week as National 
                        Military Families Week.

Whereas the people of the United States have a sincere appreciation for the 
        sacrifices being made by the families of members of the Armed Forces 
        while their loved ones are deployed in the service of their country;
Whereas military families face unique challenges while their loved ones are 
        deployed because of the lengthy and dangerous nature of these 
        deployments;
Whereas the strain on military family life is further increased when these 
        deployments become more frequent;
Whereas military families on the home front remain resilient because of their 
        comprehensive and responsive support system;
Whereas the brave members of the Armed Forces who have defended the United 
        States since September 11, 2001, continue to have incredible, unending 
        support from their families; and
Whereas the week of June 12, 2005, has been proposed to be designated as 
        National Military Families Week: Now, therefore be it
    Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring), 
That Congress--
            (1) recognizes the sacrifices of military families and the 
        support they provide for their loved ones serving as members of 
        the Armed Forces; and
            (2) supports the designation of a week as National Military 
        Families Week.
                                 <all>
