    (a) In General.--Subsection (e) of section 4261 of the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by redesignating paragraphs (4) and (5) 
as paragraphs (5) and (6), respectively, and by inserting after 
paragraph (3) the following new paragraph:
            ``(4) Segments to and from certain island airports.--
                    ``(A) Exception from segment tax.--The tax imposed 
                by subsection (b)(1) shall not apply to any domestic 
                segment beginning or ending at an airport which is a 
                qualified island airport for the calendar year in which 
                such segment begins or ends (as the case may be).
                    ``(B) Qualified island airport.--For purposes of 
                this paragraph, the term `qualified island airport' 
                means, with respect to any calendar year, any airport 
                if--
                            ``(i) such airport is located on an island 
                        having a population of 20,000 or less 
                        (determined under the 1990 decennial census), 
                        and
                            ``(ii) during the second preceding calendar 
                        year--
                                    ``(I) there were 400,000 or fewer 
                                commercial passengers departing by air 
                                from such airport, and
                                    ``(II) 50 percent or more of the 
                                initial flight segments of such 
                                commercial passengers are 100 miles or 
                                less.
                    ``(C) Ticket tax.--In the case of any domestic 
                segment beginning or ending at an airport which is a 
                qualified island airport for the calendar year in which 
                such segment begins or ends (as the case may be), 
                subsection (a) shall be applied by substituting `10 
                percent' for `7.5 percent' and paragraph (6) shall not 
                apply. A rule similar to the rule of paragraph 
                (1)(C)(ii) shall apply for purposes of this 
                subparagraph.''
    (b) Conforming Amendment.--Clause (i) of section 4261(e)(1)(C) of 
such Code is amended by striking ``Paragraph (5)'' and inserting 
``Paragraph (6)''.
    (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section shall 
apply to transportation beginning after the 7th day after the date of 
the enactment of this Act, but shall not apply to amounts paid before 
such 7th day.
