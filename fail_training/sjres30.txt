                            JOINT RESOLUTION


 
    Designating March 1, 1998 as ``United States Navy Asiatic Fleet 
                Memorial Day'', and for other purposes.

Whereas the United States established the Asiatic Fleet of the Navy in 1910 to 
        protect American nationals, policies, and possessions in the Far East;
Whereas the sailors and Marines of the Asiatic Fleet ensured the safety of 
        United States citizens and foreign nationals, and provided humanitarian 
        assistance, in that region during the Chinese civil war, the Yangtze 
        Flood of 1931, and the outbreak of Sino-Japanese hostilities;
Whereas in 1940, due to deteriorating political relations and increasing 
        tensions between the United States and Japan, a reinforced Asiatic Fleet 
        began concentrating on the defense of the Philippines and engaged in 
        extensive training to ensure maximum operational readiness for any 
        eventuality;
Whereas following the declaration of war against Japan, the warships, 
        submarines, and aircraft of the Asiatic Fleet singly or in task forces 
        courageously fought many naval battles against a superior Japanese 
        armada; and
Whereas the Asiatic Fleet directly suffered the loss of 22 ships, 1,826 men 
        killed or missing in action, and 518 men captured and imprisoned under 
        the worst of conditions with many of them dying while held as prisoners 
        of war: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. CONGRESSIONAL COMMENDATION.

    Congress--
            (1) commends the personnel who served in the Asiatic Fleet 
        of the United States Navy during the period 1910 to 1942; and
            (2) honors those who gave their lives in the line of duty 
        while serving in the Asiatic Fleet.

SEC. 2. UNITED STATES NAVY ASIATIC FLEET MEMORIAL DAY.

    (a) Designation.--March 1, 1998 is designated as ``United States 
Navy Asiatic Fleet Memorial Day''.
    (b) Proclamation.--The President is authorized and requested to 
issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United States to
