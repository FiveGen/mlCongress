                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing the sense of the Senate on the continued presence of United 
               States troops in Iraq until at least 2009.

    Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) the members of the Armed Forces deserve the enormous 
        respect and support of the Senate and the American people for 
        the sacrifices that they are making on behalf of our country; 
        and
            (2) the President's intention, as stated on March 21, 2006, 
        that ``future Presidents'' will determine whether to keep 
        members of the Armed Forces in Iraq undermines the preparedness 
        of the United States military to respond to other crises and 
        should not be supported.
                                 <all>
