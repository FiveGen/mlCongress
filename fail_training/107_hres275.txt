                               RESOLUTION


 
 Honoring the continuing service and commitment of the members of the 
  National Guard and Reserve units activated in support of Operation 
                           Enduring Freedom.

Whereas citizen-soldiers have served the United States with honor and 
        distinction since colonial times;
Whereas the more than 1,200,000 citizen-soldiers who comprise the National Guard 
        and Reserve components of the Armed Forces nationwide commit significant 
        time and effort to executing their important role in the Armed Forces;
Whereas on September 14, 2001, units of the Army Reserve, Naval Reserve, Marine 
        Corps Reserve, Coast Guard Reserve, Air Force Reserve, Army National 
        Guard of the United States, and Air National Guard of the United States 
        were authorized to be activated in support of operations in response to 
        the terrorist attacks against the United States that occurred on 
        September 11, 2001;
Whereas 336 of such units from 49 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto 
        Rico have been activated in support of Operation Enduring Freedom;
Whereas on October 29, 2001, 32,686 members of such units were on active duty, 
        including 12,391 members of the Army Reserve and Army National Guard, 
        4,650 members of the Naval Reserve, 373 members of the Marine Corps 
        Reserve, 2,529 members of the Coast Guard Reserve, and 12,743 members of 
        the Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard;
Whereas these activations represent the largest mobilization of members of the 
        National Guard and Reserve since Operation Desert Storm in 1991;
Whereas the members of these units have been ordered to active duty for a period 
        of 365 days and are not expected to return home until October 2002 at 
        the earliest;
Whereas these National Guard and Reserve citizen-soldiers are sacrificing time 
        at their civilian jobs and with their families during the period of 
        their active duty; and
Whereas these National Guard and Reserve citizen-soldiers serve a critical role 
        as part of the mission of the Armed Forces to protect the freedom of 
        United States citizens and the American ideals of justice, liberty, and 
        freedom, both at home and abroad: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) honors the continuing service and commitment of the 
        members of the National Guard and Reserve units activated in 
        support of Operation Enduring Freedom;
            (2) honors the sacrifices made by the families and 
        employers of the members of those units during their time away 
        from home;
            (3) recognizes the critical importance of the National 
        Guard and Reserve to the security of the United States; and
            (4) supports providing the necessary resources to ensure 
        the continued readiness of the National Guard and Reserve.
                                 <all>
