Commending the Secretary of Transportation and the Nation's air traffic 
 controllers for their actions to avert further tragedy following the 
                terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001.

Whereas following the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, the Secretary of 
        Transportation acted quickly and decisively in directing the Nation's 
        air traffic controllers to land and account for all aircraft in United 
        States airspace;
Whereas in response to this directive, the Nation's air traffic controllers 
        acted in a calm and professional manner in securing all of the aircraft; 
        and
Whereas the actions of the Nation's air traffic controllers may well have 
        averted further tragedy following the terrorist attacks: Now, therefore, 
        be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That Congress commends the Secretary of Transportation for his quick 
and decisive actions following the terrorist attacks on September 11, 
2001, and the Nation's air traffic controllers for their heroic actions 
on that day to avert further tragedy.
                                 <all>
