   Recognizing the efforts and activities of the National SAFE KIDS 
    Campaign to prevent all unintentional injuries among children, 
          including bicycle-related traumatic brain injuries.

Whereas unintentional injury is the number one cause of death of children under 
        the age of 15;
Whereas in 1999 more than 382,000 children under the age of 15 were treated in 
        hospital emergency rooms for bicycle-related injuries;
Whereas more than 40 percent of all bicycle-related deaths are a result of head 
        injuries and approximately three-fourths of all bicycle-related head 
        injuries occur among children under the age of 15;
Whereas every dollar spent on a bicycle helmet saves our Nation $30 in direct 
        medical costs and other costs to society;
Whereas the single most effective safety device available to reduce head injury 
        and death from bicycle crashes is a helmet;
Whereas each year motor vehicle crashes claim more than 1,700 child passengers 
        and result in an estimated 265,000 injuries;
Whereas child safety seats and safety belts, when used correctly and 
        consistently, are extremely effective in saving lives and preventing 
        injuries;
Whereas each year more than 575 children under the age of 15 die in residential 
        fires and nearly 40,000 children under the age of 15 are injured by 
        fires in the home;
Whereas households without working smoke alarms are approximately two and a half 
        times more likely to have a fire than those with working smoke alarms;
Whereas the chances of dying in a residential fire are reduced by 50 percent 
        when a smoke alarm is installed in the home;
Whereas drowning remains the leading cause of unintentional injury-related death 
        among children under the age of 5;
Whereas approximately 85 percent of boating-related drownings could be prevented 
        if the victim had been wearing a personal flotation device (PFD);
Whereas the National SAFE KIDS Campaign promotes childhood injury prevention by 
        uniting diverse groups into State and local coalitions, developing 
        innovative educational tools and strategies, initiating legislative 
        changes, promoting new technology, and raising awareness through the 
        media; and
Whereas the National SAFE KIDS Campaign will launch SAFE KIDS Week 2002, ``Use 
        Your Head, Wear A Helmet'', which focuses on the prevention of bicycle-
        related traumatic brain injury and also is concerned with the prevention 
        of all unintentional childhood injuries: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That Congress calls upon all United States citizens to recognize the 
efforts and activities of the National SAFE KIDS Campaign to prevent 
all unintentional injuries among children, including bicycle-related 
traumatic brain injuries.
