                                 A BILL


 
To amend rule 30 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to restore the 
           stenographic preference for recording depositions.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. STENOGRAPHIC PREFERENCE FOR RECORDING DEPOSITIONS.

    Paragraphs (2) and (3) of rule 30(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure are amended to read as follows:
            ``(2) Unless the court upon motion orders, or the parties 
        stipulate in writing, the deposition shall be recorded by 
        stenographic or stenomask means. The party taking the 
        deposition shall bear the cost of the transcription. Any party 
        may arrange for a transcription to be made from the recording 
        of a deposition taken by nonstenographic or nonstenomask means.
            ``(3) With prior notice to the deponent and other parties, 
        any party may use another method to record the deponent's 
        testimony in addition to the method used pursuant to paragraph 
        (2). The additional record or transcript shall be made at that 
        party's expense unless the court otherwise orders.''.
                                 <all>
