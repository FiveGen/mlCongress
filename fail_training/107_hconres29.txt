                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing the sense of the Congress regarding the conviction of ten 
                  members of Iran's Jewish community.

Whereas on the eve of the Jewish holiday of Passover 1999, 13 Jews, including 
        community and religious leaders in the cities of Shiraz and Isfahan, 
        were arrested by the authorities of the Islamic Republic of Iran and 
        accused of spying for the United States and Israel;
Whereas the 13 defendants were tried in a Revolutionary Court that was closed to 
        all independent journalists, outside media, international observers, and 
        family members;
Whereas no evidence was brought forth at these trials other than taped 
        ``confessions'';
Whereas Jews in Iran are prohibited from holding any positions that would give 
        them access to state secrets;
Whereas the judge in the case also served as prosecutor, chief investigator, and 
        arbiter of punishment;
Whereas the Secretary of State has identified the case of the 13 Jews in Shiraz 
        as ``one of the barometers of United States-Iran relations'';
Whereas countless nations have expressed their concern for these individuals and 
        especially their human rights under the rule of law;
Whereas ten of the 13 Jews were convicted on July 1, 2000, of spying for Israel, 
        and were sentenced to prison terms of four to 13 years;
Whereas the head of state of Iran has the authority to pardon the ten Iranian 
        Jews;
Whereas the international community, including former President Clinton, has 
        condemned the convictions;
Whereas Iran must show signs of respecting human rights as a prerequisite for 
        improving its relationship with the United States; and
Whereas President Khatami and the Iranian Parliament were elected on a platform 
        of moderation and reform: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That it is the sense of the Congress that the United States 
Government--
            (1) should condemn, in the strongest possible terms, the 
        arrest of the 13 Jews by the authorities of the Islamic 
        Republic of Iran, the unfair procedures employed against them 
        leading up to and throughout their trials, and the convictions 
        of ten of the 13 Jews by such authorities;
            (2) should demand that these convictions be overturned and 
        that the individuals be released forthwith;
            (3) should call on the Government of Iran to pardon the ten 
        Iranian Jews; and
            (4) should ensure that Iran's handling of this case is a 
        benchmark for determining the nature of current and future 
        United States-Iran relations.
                                 <all>
