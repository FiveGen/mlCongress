                                 A BILL


 
To achieve balance in the foreign trade of the United States, through a 
 market-based system of tradable certificates, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Balanced Trade Restoration Act of 
2006''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Since the 1990s, the United States has experienced 
        record trade deficits that has made the United States the 
        largest debtor country in the world.
            (2) In 2005, the merchandise trade deficit of the United 
        States was a record $767,000,000,000, and in 2006, the 
        merchandise trade deficit of the United States is projected to 
        surpass the record set in 2005.
            (3) The surging trade deficits could soon create a balance 
        of payments crisis for the United States, which could wreak 
        havoc with the economy of the United States.
            (4) Article XII of the General Agreement on Tariff and 
        Trade (GATT 1994), annexed to the Agreement Establishing the 
        World Trade Organization entered into on April 15, 1994, 
        permits any member country to restrict the quantity or value of 
        imports in order to safeguard the external financial position 
        and the balance of payments of the member country.
            (5) In accordance with Article XII of the GATT 1994, the 
        United States should take steps to restore balance to its 
        merchandise trade, and safeguard its external financial 
        position and its balance of payments.
            (6) The imposition of import restrictions should be phased 
        in to allow the economy of the United States to absorb the 
        impact of import restrictions with minimal disruption.
