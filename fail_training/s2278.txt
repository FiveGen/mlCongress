                                 A BILL


 
To exclude certain veterans' educational benefits from being considered 
            a resource in the computation of financial aid.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans' Educational Benefits 
Protection Act of 1998''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Having served their country with honor, veterans of the 
        Armed Forces deserve the Nation's gratitude and support.
            (2) Recognizing that education is a key element of economic 
        success and reintegration into civilian life, Congress has for 
        more than 50 years provided aid to veterans seeking 
        postsecondary education.
            (3) The escalating costs of postsecondary education make 
        veterans more dependent than ever on veterans' educational 
        benefits.
            (4) Recipients of veterans' educational benefits should not 
        be disadvantaged with respect to any other recipients of 
        Federal educational aid programs.

SEC. 3. TREATMENT OF VETERANS' EDUCATIONAL BENEFITS.

    Section 480(j)(3) (20 U.S.C. 1087vv(j)(3)) is amended by inserting 
after ``paragraph (1),'' the following: ``a post-service benefit under 
chapter 30 of title 38, United States Code, or''.
