                                 A BILL


 
 To guarantee the long-term national security of the United States by 
     investing in a robust Defense Science and Technology Program.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``National Defense Science and 
Technology Investment Act of 1998''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress of the United States finds the following:
            (1) To provide for the national security of the United 
        States in the 21st century, the U.S. military must be able to 
        dominate the full range of military operations, from 
        humanitarian assistance to full-scale conflict. The keys to 
        achieving this ``Full Spectrum Dominance,'' as described in the 
        Department of Defense's ``Joint Vision 2010,'' are 
        technological innovation and information superiority.
            (2) The global spread of advanced technology is 
        transforming the military threats faced by the United States 
        and will challenge our ability to achieve Full Spectrum 
        Dominance. Some of the major technological challenges our 
        military face include information warfare; proliferating 
        weapons of mass destruction; inexpensive, precise, cruise 
        missiles; and increasingly difficult operations in urban 
        environments.
            (3) The United States is now in a relatively secure 
        interlude in its international relations, but the future 
        security environment is very uncertain. Thus, now is the time 
        to focus our Defense investments on the research and 
        experimentation needed to meet new and undefined threats and 
        achieve Full Spectrum Dominance.
            (4) The Department of Defense has been the preeminent 
        Federal agency supporting research in engineering, mathematics, 
        and computer science, and a key supporter of research in the 
        physical and environmental sciences. These disciplines remain 
        critical to achieving information superiority and maintaining 
        technological innovation in our military. The Department of 
        Energy has played a critical role in supporting the research 
        needed to limit the spread of weapons of mass destruction. No 
        other organizations, public or private, can be expected to 
        substitute for the role of the Department of Defense and 
        Department of Energy in these research areas.
            (5) However, the current budget plan for the Defense 
        Science and Technology Program is essentially flat in real 
        terms through fiscal year 2003. The planned budget for 
        nonproliferation science and technology activities at the 
        Department of Energy will decline.
            (6) These budget plans are not consistent with the vision 
        of Full Spectrum Dominance, the threats or uncertainties on the 
        horizon, or the opportunity presented by the current state of 
        international relations. The planned level of investment could 
        pose a serious threat to our national security in the next 15 
        years, given the usual time it takes from the start of Defense 
        research to achieving new military capabilities.
            (7) Consequently, the Congress must act to establish a 
        long-term vision for the Defense Science and Technology 
        Program's funding if the United States is to encourage the 
        research and experimentation needed to seize the current 
        opportunity and begin transforming our military to meet the new 
        threats and achieve Full Spectrum Dominance early in the next 
        century.
            (8) The Congress must also act to establish a robust long-
        term vision and funding plan in support of nonproliferation 
        science and technology activities at the Department of Energy.

SEC. 3. PURPOSE AND FUNDING REQUIREMENTS.

    (a) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to create a ten-year 
budget plan to support the disciplines, research, and concept of 
operations experimentation that will transform our military and reduce 
the threat from weapons of mass destruction early in the next century.
    (b) Funding Requirements.--
            (1) Defense science and technology program budget.--For 
        each year from fiscal year 2000 until fiscal year 2008, it 
        shall be an objective of the Secretary of Defense to increase 
        the Defense Science and Technology Program budget by no less 
        than 2.0 percent over inflation greater than the previous 
        fiscal year's budget request.
            (2) Nonproliferation science and technology activities 
        budget.--For each year from fiscal year 2000 until fiscal year 
        2008, it shall be an objective of the Secretary of Energy to 
        increase the budget for nonproliferation science and technology 
        activities by no less than 2.0 percent a year over inflation 
        greater than the previous fiscal year's budget request.

SEC. 4. GUIDELINES FOR THE DEFENSE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY PROGRAM.

    (a) Synergistic Management of Research and Development.--The 
Secretary of Defense may allocate a combination of funds from 
Department of Defense 6.1, 6.2, or 6.3 accounts in supporting any 
individual project or program of the Defense Science and Technology 
Program.
    (b) Relationship of the Defense Science and Technology Program to 
Commercial Research and Technology.--
            (1) In supporting projects within the Defense Science and 
        Technology Program, the Secretary of Defense shall attempt to 
        leverage commercial research, technology, products, and 
        processes for the benefit of the Department of Defense to the 
        maximum extent practicable.
            (2) Funds made available to the Defense Science and 
        Technology Program must only be used to benefit the Department 
        of Defense, which includes--
                    (A) the development of defense unique technology;
                    (B) the development of military useful, commercial 
                viable technology; or
                    (C) the adaption of commercial technology, 
                products, or processes for military purposes.
    (c) Relationship of Defense Science and Technology Program to 
University Research.--The following shall be key objectives of the 
Defense Science and Technology Program--
            (1) the sustainment of research capabilities in scientific 
        and engineering disciplines critical to the Department of 
        Defense;
            (2) the education and training of the next generation of 
        scientists and engineers in disciplines relevant to future 
        Defense systems, particularly through the conduct of basic 
        research; and
            (3) the continued support of the Defense Experimental 
        Program to Stimulate Competitive Research and research programs 
        at Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority 
        Institutions.
