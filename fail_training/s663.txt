SEC. 2. RESERVE PRICE.

    In any auction conducted or supervised by the Federal 
Communications Commission (hereinafter the Commission) for any license, 
permit or right which has value, a reasonable reserve price shall be 
set by the Commission for each unit in the auction. The reserve price 
shall establish a minimum bid for the unit to be auctioned. If no bid
