SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Farm Animal Stewardship Purchasing 
Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF POLICY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) More humane treatment of livestock minimizes needless 
        suffering, results in safer and better working conditions for 
        persons engaged in the animal agricultural industry, brings 
        about improvement of products, and generates other benefits for 
        producers, processors, consumers, public health, and the 
        environment, which expedite an orderly flow of livestock 
        products in interstate and foreign commerce.
            (2) The Federal Government can lead by example in the 
        marketplace and encourage more humane practices by purchasing 
        products derived from livestock raised more humanely.
    (b) Declaration of Policy.--It is the policy of the United States 
that the raising of livestock, including pigs, cattle, chickens, 
turkeys, ducks, geese, goats, horses, mules, sheep, rabbits, ostriches, 
emus, rheas, and other non-aquatic animals used, or intended for use, 
as food or fiber or to produce food or fiber, shall be carried out only 
by methods that promote animal welfare.

SEC. 3. HUMANE METHODS FOR FEDERAL PROCUREMENT.

    (a) In General.--The Federal Government may not purchase any 
product derived from a covered animal used or intended for use as food 
or fiber or to produce food or fiber unless such covered animal is 
raised in compliance with subsection (b).
    (b) Compliance.--A covered animal is raised in compliance with this 
subsection only if the method of raising such covered animal provides--
            (1) adequate shelter which allows sufficient space for the 
        covered animal to stand, lie down, get up, walk, move his or 
        her head freely, rest, and turn around completely and fully 
        extend all limbs or wings without touching any part of an 
        enclosure;
            (2) daily access to adequate food and water sufficient to 
        ensure the health and well-being of the covered animal without 
        forced feeding or feed withdrawal; and
            (3) adequate veterinary care, including prompt treatment or 
        humane euthanasia of a sick or injured covered animal.

    Nothing in this Act shall apply to a covered animal--
            (1) during lawful transport;
            (2) in lawful rodeo exhibitions, State or county fair 
        exhibitions, or other similar exhibitions;
            (3) in lawful scientific or agricultural research; or
            (4) while undergoing an examination, test, treatment, or 
        operation for veterinary purposes to improve the well-being of 
        such covered animal.

SEC. 5. COVERED ANIMAL DEFINED.
