    To amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for research, 
        information, and education with respect to blood cancer.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Hematological Cancer Research 
Investment and Education Act of 2001''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that:
            (1) An estimated 109,500 people in the United States will 
        be diagnosed with leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma in 
        2001.
            (2) New cases of the blood cancers described in paragraph 
        (1) account for 8.6 percent of new cancer cases.
            (3) Those devastating blood cancers will cause the deaths 
        of an estimated 60,300 persons in the United States in 2001. 
        Every 9 minutes, a person in the United States dies from 
        leukemia, lymphoma, or multiple myeloma.
            (4) While less than 5 percent of Federal funds for cancer 
        research are spent on those blood cancers, those blood cancers 
        cause 11 percent of all cancer deaths in the United States.
            (5) Increased Federal support of research into leukemia, 
        lymphoma, and multiple myeloma has resulted and will continue 
        to result in significant advances in the treatment, and 
        ultimately the cure, of those blood cancers as well as other 
        cancers.

SEC. 3. RESEARCH, INFORMATION, AND EDUCATION WITH RESPECT TO BLOOD 
              CANCER.
