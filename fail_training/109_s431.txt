 To establish a program to award grants to improve and maintain sites 
               honoring Presidents of the United States.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Presidential Sites Improvement 
Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) there are many sites honoring Presidents located 
        throughout the United States, including Presidential 
        birthplaces, homes, museums, burial sites, and tombs;
            (2) most of the sites are owned, operated, and maintained 
        by non-Federal entities such as State and local agencies, 
        family foundations, colleges and universities, libraries, 
        historical societies, historic preservation organizations, and 
        other nonprofit organizations;
            (3) Presidential sites are often expensive to maintain;
            (4) many Presidential sites are in need of capital, 
        technological, and interpretive display improvements for which 
        funding is insufficient or unavailable; and
            (5) to promote understanding of the history of the United 
        States by recognizing and preserving historic sites linked to 
        Presidents of the United States, the Federal Government should 
        provide grants for the maintenance and improvement of 
        Presidential sites.
