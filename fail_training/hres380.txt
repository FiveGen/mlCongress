                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that no change in 
      the water level of Lake Powell is justified or appropriate.

Whereas Glen Canyon Dam was completed in 1963 and over the next 14 years created 
        Lake Powell in southern Utah and northern Arizona;
Whereas Lake Powell is 186 miles long and has 1,960 miles of shoreline;
Whereas Lake Powell and the surrounding Glen Canyon National Recreation Area 
        host nearly 3,000,000 visitors annually from every State and numerous 
        foreign countries, and generate nearly $500,000,000 a year in tourism 
        revenues;
Whereas more than 400,000 boat launches are made annually on Lake Powell by 
        recreational visitors;
Whereas the power plant at Glen Canyon Dam provides a total output capacity of 
        1,288,000 kilowatts, enough electricity for more than 400,000 
        households, and generates revenues of approximately $100,000,000 per 
        year;
Whereas Lake Powell provides water for steam generation and cooling to the 
        Navajo Generating Station, a 2,250,000 kilowatt power plant;
Whereas Lake Powell's waters support a diverse fishery of striped bass, small-
        mouth and large-mouth bass, black crappie, sunfish, walleye, threadfin 
        shad, trout, and numerous other species;
Whereas numerous bird species, including the bald eagle, the peregrine falcon, 
        grebes, gulls, terns, and others inhabit the Lake Powell area primarily 
        because of the abundant availability of fish; and
Whereas proposals are currently being made to drain Lake Powell: Now, therefore, 
        be it
    Resolved, that it is the sense of the House of Representatives 
that--
            (1) Lake Powell is a tremendous national and regional 
        resource that provides recreational opportunities, water 
        storage, power capacity, and wildlife habitat for numerous fish 
        and bird species;
            (2) significant changes in the water level of Lake Powell 
        would adversely affect those resources, the communities 
        surrounding Lake Powell, and users of Lake Powell; and
            (3) no change in the water level of Lake Powell is 
        justified or appropriate.
                                 <all>
