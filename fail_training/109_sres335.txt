Honoring members of the radiation protection profession by designating 
    the week of November 6 through November 12, 2005, as ``National 
               Radiation Protection Professionals Week''.

Whereas the Conference of Radiation Control Program Directors has resolved that 
        the week of November 6 through November 12, 2005, should be recognized 
        as ``National Radiation Protection Professionals Week'';
Whereas, since the discovery of x rays by Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen on November 8, 
        1895, the use of radiation has become a vital tool for the health care, 
        defense, security, energy, and industrial programs of the United States;
Whereas members of the radiation protection profession devote their careers to 
        allow government, medicine, academia, and industry to safely use 
        radiation; and
Whereas the leadership and technical expertise provided by members of the 
        radiation protection profession has helped safeguard the public from the 
        hazards of the use of radiation while enabling the public to reap its 
        benefits: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates the week of November 6 through November 12, 
        2005, as ``National Radiation Protection Professionals Week'';
            (2) encourages all citizens to--
                    (A) recognize the importance of radiation 
                protection professionals; and
                    (B) recognize the valuable resource provided by 
                professional scientific organizations, such as--
                            (i) the Conference of Radiation Control 
                        Program Directors;
                            (ii) the Health Physics Society;
                            (iii) the Organization of Agreement States;
                            (iv) the American Academy of Health 
                        Physics; and
                            (v) the National Registry of Radiation 
                        Protection Technologists; and
                    (C) the American Association of Physicists in 
                Medicine; and
            (3) recognizes the tremendous contributions that radiation 
        protection professionals and their organizations have made for 
        the betterment of the United States and the world.
