            (2) Air carriers described.--An air carrier described in 
        this paragraph is an air carrier that conducts operations as a

            (2) does not have an operating certificate issued under 
        part 139 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (or any 
        subsequent similar regulations); and
            (3) is located within a 35-mile radius of an airport that 
        has--
                    (A) at least 0.05 percent of the total annual

                    (B) current gate capacity to handle the demands of 
                a public charter operation.
    (c) Definitions.--In this Act:
            (1) Air carrier; air transportation; aircraft; airport.--
        The terms ``air carrier'', ``air transportation'', 
        ``aircraft'', and ``airport'' have the meanings given those

            (2) Public charter.--The term ``public charter'' means
