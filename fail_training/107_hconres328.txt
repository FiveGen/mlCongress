                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
   Expressing the sense of the Congress with respect to coverage of 
   outpatient prescription drugs under the Medicare Program and with 
  respect to providing for appropriate new budget authority for such 
                               coverage.

Whereas the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2002 established 
        a reserve fund of $300 billion for a medicare outpatient prescription 
        drug program;
Whereas the rising costs of outpatient prescription drugs presents a great 
        financial hardship for seniors and disabled individuals and impairs 
        their overall well-being;
Whereas enactment of a medicare outpatient prescription drug plan that provides 
        for a comprehensive, universal, and voluntary drug program for medicare 
        beneficiaries is needed; and
Whereas Congress and the President have pledged to enact a meaningful medicare 
        prescription drug plan: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That it is the sense of the Congress that--
            (1) an outpatient prescription drug benefit for medicare 
        beneficiaries under the medicare program should be enacted in 
        2002;
            (2) the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 
        2003 should include new budget authority for each of fiscal 
        years 2003 through 2008 to provide for coverage of outpatient 
        prescription drugs under the medicare program; and
            (3) the aggregate amount of that new budget authority for 
        fiscal years 2003 through 2008 under the concurrent resolution 
        on the budget should be $300,000,000,000.
                                 <all>
