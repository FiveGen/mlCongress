                               RESOLUTION


 
    Honoring the town of Nicodemus, Kansas, for its contribution to 
                           American history.

Whereas, in the South, the rights gained by African-Americans immediately 
        following the Civil War were largely stripped away at the end of the 
        Reconstruction period;
Whereas this Nation was founded on the ideals of freedom and equality for all;
Whereas the West was viewed as a land of opportunity;
Whereas many African-Americans left the South and moved west in search of the 
        freedom and opportunity promised to all Americans;
Whereas abolitionists shed blood for the State of Kansas to enter the Union as a 
        Free State;
Whereas Kansans welcomed African-Americans from the South making Kansas their 
        new home;
Whereas Nicodemus, Kansas, was planned and founded by six African-American men;
Whereas, on September 17, 1877, the first formal group of settlers, numbering 
        350, arrived in Nicodemus, Kansas;
Whereas Nicodemus, Kansas, offered African-Americans an opportunity to own their 
        own land, make a living farming, and prosper in a jurisdiction self-
        governed by African-Americans;
Whereas, during a time when many African-Americans were denied an education in 
        the South, African-Americans in Nicodemus, Kansas, established schools 
        to educate the town's children;
Whereas Nicodemus, Kansas, grew and prospered in the 1880s as a result of the 
        ingenuity of African-American entrepreneurs and the dedication of 
        African-American farmers;
Whereas the hard work, resourcefulness, and courage of the African-American 
        pioneers who founded and lived in Nicodemus, Kansas, serves as an 
        example of the American spirit;
Whereas Nicodemus, Kansas, is the only remaining Western town established by 
        African-Americans during the Reconstruction period;
Whereas, in January 1976, the Nicodemus Historic District was designated as a 
        National Historic Landmark;
Whereas, on November 12, 1996, Congress established the Nicodemus National 
        Historic Site to preserve, protect, and interpret the remaining 
        structures and locations that represent the history of the town of 
        Nicodemus, Kansas;
Whereas the National Park Service and the current residents of Nicodemus, 
        Kansas, are working to preserve this historic site for future 
        generations; and
Whereas, this year, Nicodemus, Kansas, will celebrate its tenth anniversary as a 
        national historic site: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved,  That the House of Representatives--
            (1) honors the town of Nicodemus, Kansas, for its 
        contribution to American history; and
            (2) commends and encourages the preservation efforts of the 
        National Park Service and the residents of Nicodemus, Kansas.
                                 <all>
