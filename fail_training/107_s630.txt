                                 A BILL


 
  To prohibit senders of unsolicited commercial electronic mail from 
 disguising the source of their messages, to give consumers the choice 
 to cease receiving a sender's unsolicited commercial electronic mail 
                   messages, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

<DELETED>SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.</DELETED>

<DELETED>    This Act may be cited as the ``Controlling the Assault of 
Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2001'', or the ``CAN-
SPAM Act of 2001''.</DELETED>

<DELETED>SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND POLICY.</DELETED>

<DELETED>    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (1) There is a right of free speech on the 
        Internet.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (2) The Internet has increasingly become a 
        critical mode of global communication and now presents 
        unprecedented opportunities for the development and growth of 
        global commerce and an integrated worldwide economy. In order 
        for global commerce on the Internet to reach its full 
        potential, individuals and entities using the Internet and 
        other online services should be prevented from engaging in 
        activities that prevent other users and Internet service 
        providers from having a reasonably predictable, efficient, and 
        economical online experience.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (3) Unsolicited commercial electronic mail can be 
        a mechanism through which businesses advertise and attract 
        customers in the online environment.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (4) The receipt of unsolicited commercial 
        electronic mail may result in costs to recipients who cannot 
        refuse to accept such mail and who incur costs for the storage 
        of such mail, or for the time spent accessing, reviewing, and 
        discarding such mail, or for both.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (5) Unsolicited commercial electronic mail may 
        impose significant monetary costs on providers of Internet 
        access services, businesses, and educational and nonprofit 
        institutions that carry and receive such mail, as there is a 
        finite volume of mail that such providers, businesses, and 
        institutions can handle without further investment. The sending 
        of such mail is increasingly and negatively affecting the 
        quality of service provided to customers of Internet access 
        service, and shifting costs from the sender of the 
        advertisement to the provider of Internet access service and 
        the recipient.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (6) While some senders of unsolicited commercial 
        electronic mail messages provide simple and reliable ways for 
        recipients to reject (or ``opt-out'' of) receipt of unsolicited 
        commercial electronic mail from such senders in the future, 
        other senders provide no such ``opt-out'' mechanism, or refuse 
        to honor the requests of recipients not to receive electronic 
        mail from such senders in the future, or both.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (7) An increasing number of senders of unsolicited 
        commercial electronic mail purposefully disguise the source of 
        such mail so as to prevent recipients from responding to such 
        mail quickly and easily.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (8) An increasing number of senders of unsolicited 
        commercial electronic mail purposefully include misleading 
        information in the message's subject lines in order to induce 
        the recipients to view the messages.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (9) Because recipients of unsolicited commercial 
        electronic mail are unable to avoid the receipt of such mail 
        through reasonable means, such mail may invade the privacy of 
        recipients.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (10) The practice of sending unsolicited 
        commercial electronic mail is sufficiently profitable that 
        senders of such mail will not be unduly burdened by the costs 
        associated with providing an ``opt-out'' mechanism to 
        recipients and ensuring that recipients who exercise such opt-
        out do not receive further messages from that sender.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (11) In legislating against certain abuses on the 
        Internet, Congress should be very careful to avoid infringing 
        in any way upon constitutionally protected rights, including 
        the rights of assemble, free speech, and privacy.</DELETED>
<DELETED>    (b) Congressional Determination of Public Policy.--On the 
basis of the findings in subsection (a), the Congress determines that--
</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (1) there is substantial government interest in 
        regulation of unsolicited commercial electronic mail;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (2) senders of unsolicited commercial electronic 
        mail should not mislead recipients as to the source or content 
        of such mail; and</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (3) recipients of unsolicited commercial 
        electronic mail have a right to decline to receive additional 
        unsolicited commercial electronic mail from the same 
        source.</DELETED>

Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2002'', or the ``CANSPAM Act 
of 2002''.

SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND POLICY.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:
            (1) There is a right of free speech on the Internet.
            (2) The Internet has increasingly become a critical mode of 
        global communication and now presents unprecedented 
        opportunities for the development and growth of global commerce 
        and an integrated worldwide economy.
            (3) In order for global commerce on the Internet to reach 
        its full potential, individuals and entities using the Internet 
        and other online services should be prevented from engaging in 
        activities that prevent other users and Internet service 
        providers from having a reasonably predictable, efficient, and 
        economical online experience.
            (4) Unsolicited commercial electronic mail can be a 
        mechanism through which businesses advertise and attract 
        customers in the online environment.
            (5) The receipt of unsolicited commercial electronic mail 
        may result in costs to recipients who cannot refuse to accept 
        such mail and who incur costs for the storage of such mail, or 
        for the time spent accessing, reviewing, and discarding such 
        mail, or for both.
            (6) Unsolicited commercial electronic mail may impose 
        significant monetary costs on providers of Internet access 
        services, businesses, and educational and nonprofit 
        institutions that carry and receive such mail, as there is a 
        finite volume of mail that such providers, businesses, and 
        institutions can handle without further investment in 
        infrastructure.
            (7) Some unsolicited commercial electronic mail contains 
        material that many recipients may consider vulgar or 
        pornographic in nature.
            (8) While some senders of unsolicited commercial electronic 
        mail messages provide simple and reliable ways for recipients 
        to reject (or ``opt-out'' of) receipt of unsolicited commercial 
        electronic mail from such senders in the future, other senders 
        provide no such ``opt-out'' mechanism, or refuse to honor the 
        requests of recipients not to receive electronic mail from such 
        senders in the future, or both.
            (9) An increasing number of senders of unsolicited 
        commercial electronic mail purposefully disguise the source of 
        such mail so as to prevent recipients from responding to such 
        mail quickly and easily.
            (10) An increasing number of senders of unsolicited 
        commercial electronic mail purposefully include misleading 
        information in the message's subject lines in order to induce 
        the recipients to view the messages.
            (11) In legislating against certain abuses on the Internet, 
        Congress should be very careful to avoid infringing in any way 
        upon constitutionally protected rights, including the rights of 
        assembly, free speech, and privacy.
    (b) Congressional Determination of Public Policy.--On the basis of 
the findings in subsection (a), the Congress determines that--
            (1) there is a substantial government interest in 
        regulation of unsolicited commercial electronic mail;
            (2) senders of unsolicited commercial electronic mail 
        should not mislead recipients as to the source or content of 
        such mail; and
            (3) recipients of unsolicited commercial electronic mail 
        have a right to decline to receive additional unsolicited 
        commercial electronic mail from the same source.

        unlawful for any person to initiate the transmission to a 
        protected computer of a commercial electronic mail message with

        about a material fact regarding the contents or subject matter 
        of the message.
            (3) Inclusion of return address or comparable mechanism in

                        electronic mail messages from that sender at 
                        the electronic mail address where the message 
                        was received; and
                            (ii) remains capable of receiving such

                        message.
                    (B) More detailed requests possible.--Nothing in 
                subparagraph (A) prohibits the sender of a commercial

                of submitting more detailed requests concerning the 
                types of commercial electronic mail messages that the 
                recipient does or does not wish to receive in the 
                future from the sender or from some or all affiliates

                    (C) Temporary inability to receive messages.--A

                the recipient, more than 10 days after the receipt of 
                such request, of an unsolicited commercial electronic 
                mail message that falls within the scope of the 
                request;
                    (B) for any person acting on behalf of the sender 
                to initiate the transmission to the recipient, more 
                than 10 days after the receipt of such request, of an

                unsolicited commercial electronic mail message that the

        message through the provision or selection of addresses to 
        which the message will be sent, if such person knows that, or 
        acts with reckless disregard as to whether--
                    (A) the electronic mail address of the recipient 
                was obtained, using an automated means, from an 
                Internet website or proprietary online service operated 
                by another person; or
                    (B) the website or proprietary online service from 
                which the address was obtained included, at the time 
                the address was obtained, a notice stating that the 
                operator of such a website or proprietary online 
                service will not give, sell, or otherwise transfer 
                addresses maintained by such site or service to any 
                other party for the purpose of initiating, or enabling 
                others to initiate, unsolicited electronic mail 
                messages.
            (2) Disclaimer.--Nothing in this subsection creates an 
        ownership or proprietary interest in such email addresses.
    (c) Affirmative Defense.--A person shall not be found to have 
violated paragraph (2), (3), (4), or (5) of subsection (a) if--
            (1) that person has established and implemented, with due 
        care, reasonable practices and procedures to effectively 
        prevent violations of this section; and

    (e) Enforcement by States.--
            (1) Civil action.--In any case in which the attorney 
        general of a State has reason to believe that an interest of 
        the residents of that State has been or is threatened or 
        adversely affected by any person engaging in a practice that 
        violates section 5 of this Act, the State, as parens patriae, 
        may bring a civil action on behalf of the residents of the 
        State in a district court of the United States of appropriate 
        jurisdiction or in any other court of competent jurisdiction--
                    (A) to enjoin that practice; or
                    (B) to obtain damages on behalf of residents of the 
                State, in an amount equal to the greater of--
                            (i) the actual monetary loss suffered by 
                        such residents; or
                            (ii) the amount determined under paragraph 
                        (2).
            (2) Statutory damages.--
                    (A) In general.--For purposes of paragraph 
                (1)(B)(ii), the amount determined under this paragraph 
                is the amount calculated by multiplying the number of 
                willful, knowing, or negligent violations by an amount, 
                in the discretion of the court, of up to $10 (with each 
                separately addressed unlawful message received by such 
                residents treated as a separate violation). In 
                determining the per-violation penalty under this 
                subparagraph, the court shall take into account the 
                degree of culpability, any history of prior such 
                conduct, ability to pay, the extent of economic gain 
                resulting from the violation, and such other matters as 
                justice may require.
                    (B) Limitation.--For any violation of paragraph 
                (2), (3), (4), or (5) of section 5(a), the amount 
                determined under subparagraph (A) may not exceed 
                $500,000, except that if the court finds that the 
                defendant committed the violation willfully and 
                knowingly, the court may increase the limitation 
                established by this paragraph from $500,000 to an 
                amount not to exceed $1,500,000.
            (3) Attorney fees.--In the case of any successful action 
        under paragraph (1), the State shall be awarded the costs of 
        the action and reasonable attorney fees as determined by the 
        court.
            (4) Notice.--
                    (A) Pre-filing.--Before filing an action under 
                paragraph (1), an attorney general shall provide to the 
                Commission--
                            (i) written notice of that action; and
                            (ii) a copy of the complaint for that 
                        action.
                    (B) Contemporaneous.--If an attorney general 
                determines that it is not feasible to provide the 
                notice required by subparagraph (A) before filing the 
                action, the notice and a copy of the complaint shall be 
                provided to the Commission when the action is filed.
            (5) Intervention.--If the Commission receives notice under 
        paragraph (4), it--
                    (A) may intervene in the action that is the subject 
                of the notice; and
                    (B) has the right--
                            (i) to be heard with respect to any matter 
                        that arises in that action; and
                            (ii) to file a petition for appeal.
            (6) Construction.--For purposes of bringing any civil 
        action under paragraph (1), nothing in this Act shall be 
        construed to prevent an attorney general of a State from 
        exercising the powers conferred on the attorney general by the 
        laws of that State to--
                    (A) conduct investigations;
                    (B) administer oaths or affirmations; or
                    (C) compel the attendance of witnesses or the 
                production of documentary and other evidence.
            (7) Venue; service of process.--
                    (A) Venue.--Any action brought under paragraph (1) 
                may be brought in the district court of the United 
                States that meets applicable requirements relating to 
                venue under section 1391 of title 28, United States 
                Code.
                    (B) Service of process.--In an action brought under 
                paragraph (1), process may be served in any district in 
                which the defendant--
                            (i) is an inhabitant; or
                            (ii) maintains a physical place of 
                        business.
            (8) Limitation on state action while federal action is 
        pending.--If the Commission or other appropriate Federal agency 
        under subsection (b) has instituted a civil action or an 
administrative action for violation of this Act, no State attorney 
general may bring an action under this subsection during the pendency 
of that action against any defendant named in the complaint of the 
Commission or the other agency for any violation of this Act alleged in 
the complaint.
    (f) Action by Provider of Internet Access Service.--
            (1) Action authorized.--A provider of Internet access 
        service adversely affected by a violation of section 5 may 
        bring a civil action in any district court of the United States 
        with jurisdiction over the defendant, or in any other court of 
        competent jurisdiction, to--
                    (A) enjoin further violation by the defendant; or
                    (B) recover damages in an amount equal to the 
                greater of--
                            (i) actual monetary loss incurred by the 
                        provider of Internet access service as a result 
                        of such violation; or
                            (ii) the amount determined under paragraph 
                        (2).
            (2) Statutory damages.--
                    (A) In general.--For purposes of paragraph 
                (1)(B)(ii), the amount determined under this paragraph 
                is the amount calculated by multiplying the number of 
                willful, knowing, or negligent violations by an amount, 
                in the discretion of the court, of up to $10 (with each 
                separately addressed unlawful message received by such 
                residents treated as a separate violation). In 
                determining the per-violation penalty under this 
                subparagraph, the court shall take into account the 
                degree of culpability, any history of prior such 
                conduct, ability to pay, the extent of economic gain 
                resulting from the violation, and such other matters as 
                justice may require.
                    (B) Limitation.--For any violation of paragraph 
                (2), (3), (4), or (5) of section 5(a), the amount 
                determined under subparagraph (A) may not exceed 
                $500,000, except that if the court finds that the 
                defendant committed the violation willfully and 
                knowingly, the court may increase the limitation 
                established by this paragraph from $500,000 to an 
                amount not to exceed $1,500,000.
            (3) Attorney fees.--In any action brought pursuant to 
        paragraph (1), the court may, in its discretion, require an 
        undertaking for the payment of the costs of such action, and 
        assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, 
        against any party.

SEC. 7. EFFECT ON OTHER LAWS.

    (a) Federal Law.--

Service.--Nothing in this Act shall be construed to have any effect on
