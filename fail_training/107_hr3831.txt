                                 A BILL


 
To amend title 10, United States Code, to reduce the age for receipt of 
      military retired pay for non-regular service from 60 to 55.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. REDUCTION IN AGE FOR RECEIPT OF MILITARY RETIRED PAY FOR 
              NON-REGULAR SERVICE.

    (a) Reduction in Age.--Section 12731(a)(1) of title 10, United 
States Code, is amended by striking ``at least 60 years of age'' and 
inserting ``at least 55 years of age''.
    (b) Application to Existing Provisions of Law or Policy.--With 
respect to any provision of law, or of any policy, regulation, or 
directive of the executive branch, that refers to a member or former 
member of the uniformed services as being eligible for, or entitled to, 
retired pay under chapter 1223 of title 10, United States Code, but for 
the fact that the member or former member is under 60 years of age, 
such provision shall be carried out with respect to that member or 
former member by substituting for the reference to being 60 years of 
age a reference to the age in effect for qualification for such retired 
pay under section 12731(a) of title 10, United States Code, as amended 
by subsection (a).
    (c) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) shall 
take effect on the first day of the first month beginning on or after 
the date of the enactment of this Act and shall apply to retired pay 
payable for that month and subsequent months.
                                 <all>
