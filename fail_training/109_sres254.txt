    Mr. Feingold (for himself and Mr. Kohl) submitted the following

                               RESOLUTION


 
  Marking the dedication of the Gaylord Nelson Wilderness within the 
                  Apostle Islands National Lakeshore.

Whereas the Honorable Gaylord Nelson, a State Senator, Governor, and United 
        States Senator from Wisconsin, devoted his life to protecting the 
        environment by championing issues of land protection, wildlife habitat, 
        environmental health, and increased environmental awareness, including 
        founding Earth Day;
Whereas the Honorable Gaylord Nelson authored the Apostle Islands National 
        Lakeshore Act, which led to the protection of one of the most beautiful 
        areas in Wisconsin and recognized the rich assemblage of natural 
        resources, cultural heritage, and scenic features on Wisconsin's north 
        coast and 21 islands of the 22-island archipelago;
Whereas the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore was designated a National Park on 
        September 26, 1970;
Whereas, on December 8, 2004, approximately 80 percent of the Apostle Islands 
        National Lakeshore was designated the Gaylord Nelson Wilderness;
Whereas the Gaylord Nelson Wilderness within the Apostle Islands National 
        Lakeshore provides a refuge for many species of birds, including 
        threatened bald eagles and endangered piping plovers, herring-billed 
        gulls, double-crested cormorants, and great blue herons, and is a safe 
        haven for a variety of amphibians, such as blue-spotted salamanders, 
        red-backed salamanders, gray treefrogs, and mink frogs, and is a 
        sanctuary for several mammals, including river otters, black bears, 
        snowshoe hares, and fishers;
Whereas the official dedication of the Gaylord Nelson Wilderness occurred on 
        August 8, 2005, 36 days after the Honorable Gaylord Nelson's passing; 
        and
Whereas the Honorable Gaylord Nelson changed the consciousness of our Nation and 
        embodied the principle that 1 person can change the world, and the 
        creation of the Gaylord Nelson Wilderness is a small, but fitting, 
        recognition of his efforts: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes the Honorable Gaylord Nelson's environmental 
        legacy;
            (2) celebrates the dedication of the Gaylord Nelson 
        Wilderness within the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore; and
            (3) requests that the Secretary of the Senate transmit an 
        enrolled copy of this resolution to the family of the Senator.
                                 <all>
