                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
   Expressing the sense of the Congress that the States should adopt 
 uniform voting procedures to carry out the election of the President 
                          and Vice President.

Whereas despite Federal efforts to increase uniformity in voting procedures for 
        elections for Federal office, there remains much variation in such 
        procedures among the States;
Whereas a major goal of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (commonly 
        known as the ``Motor-Voter Act'') was the standardization of voter 
        registration procedures for elections for Federal office to prevent 
        voter fraud and provide an accurate list of eligible voters;
Whereas under the provisions of the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee 
        Voting Act, absent uniformed services voters and overseas voters can 
        vote by absentee ballot in elections for Federal office and, if a State 
        does not provide an official State absentee ballot in response to a 
        timely request, can write in the names of candidates on a Federal write-
        in absentee ballot;
Whereas in North Dakota and in some counties in Wisconsin, individuals may vote 
        without registering;
Whereas individuals in Idaho, New Hampshire, Maine, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and 
        Wyoming may register to vote on the day of the election;
Whereas the duration of the residency requirement for voter registration varies 
        from State to State from 1 to 30 days;
Whereas in 7 States disability or illness does not provide sufficient grounds 
        for registering as an absentee voter, and in 4 States disability or 
        illness does not provide sufficient grounds for voting as an absentee;
Whereas a few States allow any citizen who is out of the United States or the 
        State to register as an absentee voter;
Whereas at least 7 different types of voting equipment are used to carry out 
        Presidential elections throughout the United States, and the type of 
        equipment used is determined on the county level; and
Whereas the opening time for polling places in Federal elections varies from 
        6:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m., and the closing time for such polling places 
        varies from 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m.: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That it is the sense of the Congress that the States should adopt 
uniform procedures to carry out the election of the President and Vice 
President, including uniform procedures for voter registration, 
absentee voting, early voting, and voting hours on the day of the 
election.
