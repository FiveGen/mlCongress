                                 A BILL


 
To establish a program to revitalize rural multifamily housing assisted 
                     under the Housing Act of 1949.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Saving America's Rural Housing Act 
of 2006''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--
            (1) section 502(c) of the Housing Act of 1949 restricts the 
        rights of certain owners of projects for which loans were made 
        or insured under section 515 of such Act to prepay such loans;
            (2) expensive litigation against the Department of 
        Agriculture has cost the taxpayers of the United States 
        millions of dollars to date, funds that would be better spent 
        preserving affordable multifamily housing;
            (3) if such section 502(c) is partially repealed and the 
        prepayment restrictions are eliminated for multifamily housing 
        loans made before 1989 under section 515, it is expected, 
        according to a report, that approximately 10 percent of the 
        portfolio of such loans would be prepaid and those projects 
        would leave the program;
            (4) the average age of a multifamily housing project with a 
        section 515 loan is 28 years, and therefore much of the 
        portfolio of such projects is aging and in need of 
        revitalization, while the need for affordable rural housing is 
        increasing;
            (5) section 515 projects house some of the poorest families 
        in rural America, with almost 60 percent of the units occupied 
        by senior citizens or persons with disabilities and an average 
        annual household income among all occupants of approximately 
        $10,000;
            (6) in many small towns and communities, rental housing 
        financed by direct loans under section 515 is the only decent, 
        affordable rental housing available.; and
            (7) consequently, any revitalization or disposition of this 
        portfolio, which houses nearly 450,000 low-income families and 
        seniors, should be handled with great care.
    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--
            (1) to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to carry out 
        a program that encourages, to the extent practicable, the 
        retention of section 515 housing project developments for long-
        term use and the repair and preservation of such properties, 
        and ensures that the minimum number of residents are displaced;
            (2) to repeal a portion of section 502(c) of the Housing 
        Act of 1949 to avoid further costly litigation against the 
        Department of Agriculture;
            (3) to preserve the availability of affordable rural 
        housing by providing a voluntary mechanism for owners of 
        multifamily rural housing projects with loans under section 515 
        to enter into loan restructuring agreements with the Secretary 
        to provide capital for revitalization activities; and
            (4) to provide for affordable rents for tenants who live in 
        such projects that are revitalized under this Act and to 
        protect tenants who live in such projects for which the loan is 
        prepaid.

SEC. 3. REVITALIZATION OF MULTIFAMILY HOUSING.

    (a) Revitalization Program.--Title V of the Housing Act of 1949 (42 
U.S.C. 1471 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following new 
section:

    ``(a) Purpose.--The purposes of this section are--
            ``(1) to protect tenants who live in multifamily housing 
        projects that are subsidized under this title and, in the case 
        of prepayments of loans under section 515, to protect tenants 
        that are displaced when the projects cease being eligible 
        projects;
            ``(2) to strengthen the long-term viability of eligible 
        projects;
            ``(3) to promote the revitalization of rural multifamily 
        housing projects; and

                financial assistance to rehabilitate and maintain the 
                projects; and
                    ``(B) by deregulating certain projects in a manner 
                that still provides measurable performance standards 
                and effective financing and rehabilitation of 
                multifamily housing.
    ``(b) Revitalization.--
            ``(1) In general.--The Secretary shall, subject to the 
        availability of amounts appropriated, carry out a 
        revitalization program in accordance with this subsection to

        eligible projects through voluntary long-term use agreements 
        entered into between the project owners and the Secretary.
            ``(2) Applications to participate.--The Secretary may 
        accept applications from owners of eligible projects to 
        participate in the revitalization program under this section.
