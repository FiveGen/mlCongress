                               RESOLUTION


 
                  Honoring Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

Whereas Franklin Delano Roosevelt was elected 4 times as the 32d President of 
        the United States for 12 years, the longest serving Chief Executive in 
        the Nation's history;
Whereas Franklin D. Roosevelt took office during the Great Depression of the 
        1930s during which nearly one quarter of the American workforce became 
        unemployed;
Whereas the dramatic domestic policies of the Roosevelt Administration offered a 
        ``New Deal'' for everyone, especially the unemployed, discouraged, and 
        desperate American workforce;
Whereas through the innovative and dynamic policies of President Roosevelt, 
        including the Civilian Conservation Corps, the Public Works 
        Administration, the Civil Works Administration, and the Works Progress 
        Administration, millions of Americans found jobs and during the Second 
        World War the Nation's economy was restored;
Whereas the Works Progress Administration not only employed 8,500,000 workers in 
        construction and other jobs, and also helped preserve and enhance the 
        American environment and culture by employing workers on the land, in 
        the arts, theater, and in literary projects;
Whereas policies of the Roosevelt Administration promoted the economic 
        development and soil and water conservation in America's rural 
        communities by creating stable farm programs and by expanding rural 
        electrification, irrigation, and flood control projects;
Whereas President Roosevelt signed into law the Wagner Act which established the 
        basic rights of working people to free association and collective 
        bargaining in the United States, and which created the National Labor 
        Relations Board;
Whereas President Roosevelt won enactment of legislation creating the Social 
        Security system in 1935, a program that has dramatically reduced elderly 
        poverty in America while never missing a payment in 70 years;
Whereas the Social Security system has provided additional benefits to millions 
        of survivors and disabled Americans, without missing a single payment in 
        70 years;
Whereas President Roosevelt created the Securities and Exchange Commission and 
        the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to protect investors, and 
        particularly the retirement savings of the American people;
Whereas President Roosevelt's life demonstrates the full and enduring 
        contributions by disabled Americans to the strength, growth and richness 
        of our country;
Whereas President Roosevelt built a strong and enduring alliance with our 
        European allies throughout his Administration and led the Nation in 
        coming to their defense against Nazi aggression;
Whereas President Roosevelt provided great leadership for our Nation in the dark 
        hours following the attack by Imperial Japan at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii on 
        December 7, 1941;
Whereas President Roosevelt led our Nation throughout World War II and developed 
        the post-war plans and alliances that have contributed to American 
        security for over 3 generations, including the structure of the United 
        Nations; and
Whereas on April 12, 2005, the Nation will mark the 60th anniversary of the 
        sudden passing of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt: Now, therefore, 
        be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) commemorates the 60th anniversary of the passing of 
        President Franklin Delano Roosevelt;
            (2) honors his vital legacy and his profound contributions 
        to the Nation; and
            (3) calls upon all Americans to honor President Roosevelt 
        for his steadfast leadership and extensive and lasting 
        contributions to the security and prosperity of all Americans.
                                 <all>
