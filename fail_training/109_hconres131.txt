                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing the sense of Congress relating to a free trade agreement 
         between the United States and the European Union (EU).

Whereas member countries of the European Union (EU) constitute many of the 
        oldest and closest allies of the United States;
Whereas the economic relationship between the United States and the EU is the 
        largest in the world;
Whereas the current account, the most comprehensive measure of trade flows of 
        the United States, demonstrates that $966,000,000,000 flowed between the 
        United States and the EU in 2004;
Whereas the EU represents the second largest trading partner of the United 
        States in goods, accounting for $447,000,000,000 in cross-border 
        merchandise trade in 2004;
Whereas trade in services between the United States and the EU was valued at 
        more than $224,000,000,000 in 2004;
Whereas the EU is the largest trading partner of the United States when both 
        goods and services are taken into account;
Whereas several trans-Atlantic trade issues exist that would benefit from 
        comprehensive bilateral negotiations;
Whereas these issues involve a broad range of regulatory regimes, public 
        policies, and public and private stakeholders; and
Whereas workers, consumers, business owners, and investors benefit substantially 
        from the reduction of tariffs and non-tariff barriers to trade: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That it is the sense of the Congress that the United States should 
expand trade opportunities with the European Union (EU) by initiating 
negotiations to enter into a free trade agreement with the EU.
                                 <all>
