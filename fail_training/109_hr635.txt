            (1) Since the founding of the United States, Poland has 
        proven its steadfast dedication to the causes of freedom and

        Kosciuszko during the American Revolution.
            (2) Polish history provides pioneering examples of 
        constitutional democracy and religious tolerance.
            (3) The United States is home to nearly 9,000,000 people of 
        Polish ancestry.
            (4) Polish immigrants have contributed greatly to the 
        success of industry and agriculture in the United States.

        stable, democratic nation.
            (6) Poland has adopted economic policies that promote free 
        markets and rapid economic growth.
            (7) On March 12, 1999, Poland demonstrated its commitment 
        to global security by becoming a member of the North Atlantic
