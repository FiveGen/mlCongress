                                 A BILL


 
To direct the Secretary of Agriculture to conduct research, monitoring, 
 management, treatment, and outreach activities relating to sudden oak 
 death syndrome and to establish a Sudden Oak Death Syndrome Advisory 
                               Committee.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Sudden Oak Death Syndrome Control 
Act of 2001''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) tan oak, coast live oak, Shreve's oak, and black oak 
        trees are among the most beloved features of the topography of 
        California and the Pacific Northwest and efforts should be made 
        to protect those trees from disease;
            (2) the die-off of those trees, as a result of the exotic 
        Phytophthora fungus, is approaching epidemic proportions;
            (3) very little is known about the new species of 
        Phytophthora, and scientists are struggling to understand the 
        causes of sudden oak death syndrome, the methods of 
        transmittal, and how sudden oak death syndrome can best be 
        treated;
            (4) the Phytophthora fungus has been found on--
                    (A) Rhododendron plants in nurseries in California; 
                and
                    (B) wild huckleberry plants, potentially 
                endangering the commercial blueberry and cranberry 
                industries;
            (5) sudden oak death syndrome threatens to create major 
        economic and environmental problems in California, the Pacific 
        Northwest, and other regions, including--
                    (A) the increased threat of fire and fallen trees;
                    (B) the cost of tree removal and a reduction in 
                property values; and
                    (C) loss of revenue due to--
                            (i) restrictions on imports of oak products 
                        and nursery stock; and
                            (ii) the impact on the commercial 
                        rhododendron, blueberry, and cranberry 
                        industries; and
            (6) Oregon and Canada have imposed an emergency quarantine 
        on the importation of oak trees, oak products, and certain 
        nursery plants from California.

            (4) maintain a geographic information system database;
            (5) conduct research activities, including research on 
        forest pathology, Phytophthora ecology, forest insects 
        associated with oak decline, urban forestry, arboriculture, 
        forest ecology, fire management, silviculture, landscape 
        ecology, and epidemiology;

        facilities, reforestation, resistant tree breeding, and exotic 
        weed control;
            (3) increase and improve firefighting and emergency 
        response capabilities in areas where fire hazard has increased 
        due to oak die-off;
            (4) treat vegetation to prevent fire, and assessment of 
        fire risk, in areas heavily infected with sudden oak death 
        syndrome;
            (5) conduct national surveys and inspections of--
                    (A) commercial rhododendron and blueberry 
                nurseries; and
                    (B) native rhododendron and huckleberry plants;
            (6) provide for monitoring of oaks and other vulnerable
