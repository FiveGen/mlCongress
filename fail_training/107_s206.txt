        <DELETED>    (2) developments since 1935, including changes in

        <DELETED>    (3) there is a continuing need for State

        in a holding company system, to the extent that such 
        information is relevant to rates paid by utility customers, 
        while affording companies the flexibility required to compete 
        in the energy markets; and</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (2) to address protection of electric and gas 
        utility customers by providing for Federal and State access to

            (2) developments since 1935, including changes in other 
        regulation and in the electric and gas industries, have called 
        into question the continued relevance of the model of 
        regulation established by that Act;
            (3) there is a continuing need for State regulation in 
        order to ensure the rate protection of utility customers; and
            (4) limited Federal regulation is necessary to supplement 
        the work of State commissions for the continued rate protection 
        of electric and gas utility customers.
    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--
            (1) to eliminate unnecessary regulation, yet continue to 
        provide for consumer protection by facilitating existing rate 
        regulatory authority through improved Federal and State

        relevant to rates paid by utility customers, while affording 
        companies the flexibility required to compete in the energy 
        markets; and
            (2) to address protection of electric and gas utility 
        customers by providing for Federal and State access to books 
        and records of all companies in a holding company system that
