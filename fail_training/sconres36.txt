     Commemorating the bicentennial of Tunisian-American relations.

Whereas August 28, 1997, will mark the 200th anniversary of the first Tunisian-
        American Treaty and the opening of diplomatic relations between Tunisia 
        and the United States;
Whereas Tunisia guaranteed to the young American Republic freedom of navigation 
        in Tunisia's territorial waters and freedom of trade with Tunisian 
        citizens;
Whereas Tunisia supported the Allies politically and militarily during World War 
        II and has become the final resting place of thousands of American 
        soldiers fallen in battle;
Whereas the United States was the first great power to recognize Tunisia's 
        independence from France in 1956;
Whereas Tunisia was a steady and reliable ally of the United States during the 
        darkest days of the Cold War, providing naval facilities to the United 
        States Sixth Fleet and supporting the United States at the United 
        Nations and other international bodies;
Whereas Tunisia after independence received more aid from the United States than 
        from any other donor country in the form of governmental loans and 
        technical assistance;
Whereas Tunisia efficiently utilized American assistance and its own resources 
        to drastically improve social conditions, further economic development, 
        and establish an open market economy and a tolerant society based on the 
        principles of democracy, social peace, and justice;
Whereas Tunisia has consistently supported a peaceful resolution to the Arab-
        Israeli conflict and United States efforts to bring peace to the Middle 
        East; and
Whereas Tunisia and the United States have always shared mutual interests in 
        regional security and have built a close partnership in that regard: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring), 
That the Congress hereby acknowledges with gratitude and appreciation 
the bicentennial of the Tunisian-American Treaty of 1797 and expresses 
to the people of Tunisia its hopes and wishes for continued friendship 
and amity between our two great nations.
    Sec. 2. The Secretary of the Senate shall transmit a copy of this 
concurrent resolution to the President with the request that he further 
transmit a copy to the Government of Tunisia.
