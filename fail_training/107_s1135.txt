        purposes of this section, the term `national coverage 
        determination' means a determination by the Commission with 
        respect to whether or not a particular item or service is 
        covered nationally under this title, but does not include a 
        determination of what code, if any, is assigned to a particular 
        item or service covered under this title or a determination 
        with respect to the amount of payment made for a particular 
        item or service so covered.

            ``(1) In general.--Review of any national coverage 
        determination shall be subject to the following limitations:
                    ``(A) Such a determination shall not be reviewed by 
                any administrative law judge.
                    ``(B) Such a determination shall not be held 
                unlawful or set aside on the ground that a requirement 
                of section 553 of title 5, United States Code, relating 
                to publication in the Federal Register or opportunity 
                for public comment, was not satisfied.

                aggrieved person (as described in paragraph (4)), such 
                a determination shall be reviewed by the Appeals Board 
                of the Commission. In conducting such a review, the 
                Appeals Board--

                        permit discovery and the taking of evidence to 
                        evaluate the reasonableness of the 
                        determination, if the Board determines that the 
                        record is incomplete or lacks adequate 
                        information to support the validity of the 
                        determination;

                        findings of fact, reasonable interpretations of 
                        law, and reasonable applications of fact to law 
                        by the Commission.

                final agency action and is subject to judicial review.

        of a determination that may otherwise be subject to review 
        under paragraph (1)(C), where the moving party alleges that--
                    ``(A) there are no material issues of fact in 
                dispute; and
                    ``(B) the only issue of law is the 
                constitutionality of a provision of this title, or that 
                a regulation, determination, or ruling by the 
                Commission is invalid,
        the moving party may seek review by a court of competent 
        jurisdiction without filing a complaint under such paragraph 
        and without otherwise exhausting other administrative remedies.

                has not issued a national coverage or noncoverage 
                determination with respect to a particular type or 
                class of items or services, an aggrieved person (as 
                described in paragraph (4)) may submit to the 
                Commission a request to make such a determination with 
                respect to such items or services. By not later than
