                                 A BILL


 
To criminalize Internet scams involving fraudulently obtaining personal 
                information, commonly known as phishing.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Anti-phishing Act of 2005''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) American society is increasingly dependent on the 
        Internet for communications, entertainment, commerce, and 
        banking.
            (2) For the Internet to reach its full potential in these 
        and other respects, it must continue to be a trustworthy 
        medium. This means, for example, that Internet users should be 
        able to trust the stated origin of Internet communications and 
        the stated destination of Internet hyperlinks.
            (3) Internet users are increasingly subjected to scams 
        based on misleading or false communications that trick the user 
        into sending money, or trick the user into revealing enough 
        information to enable various forms of identity theft that 
        result in financial loss.
            (4) One class of such scams, called ``phishing'', uses 
        false e-mail return addresses, stolen graphics, stylistic 
        imitation, misleading or disguised hyperlinks, so-called 
        ``social engineering'', and other artifices to trick users into 
        revealing personally identifiable information. After obtaining 
        this information, the ``phisher'' then uses the information to 
        create unlawful identification documents and/or to unlawfully 
        obtain money or property.
            (5) These crimes victimize not only the individuals whose 
        information is stolen, but the entire online community, 
        including millions of people who rely on the integrity of the 
        Internet's system of addresses and hyperlinks.
