  Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that Attorney 
 General Janet Reno should apply to the Special Division of the United 
 States Court of Appeals for the appointment of an independent counsel 
  to investigate a number of matters relating to the campaign finance 
 investigation currently being conducted by the Department of Justice.

Whereas the majority of the members of the Committee on the Judiciary of the 
        House of Representatives, in letters dated March 12, 1997, and September 
        3, 1997, requested that the Attorney General apply for the appointment 
        of an independent counsel for the campaign finance investigation and 
        related matters;
Whereas the majority of the members of the Committee on the Judiciary of the 
        Senate, in a letter dated March 13, 1997, requested that the Attorney 
        General request the appointment of an independent counsel for the 
        campaign finance investigation and related matters;
Whereas the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Louis Freeh, in a 
        memorandum sent to the Attorney General in November 1997, called for the 
        appointment of an independent counsel for the campaign finance 
        investigation and related matters; and
Whereas after a 10-month inquiry, Charles G. LaBella, the supervising attorney 
        of the Department of Justice's Campaign Finance Task Force, has 
        submitted a report to the Attorney General recommending that she request 
        the appointment of an independent counsel for the campaign finance 
        investigation and related matters: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House that--
            (1) the Attorney General should faithfully uphold and 
        execute the laws she has sworn to uphold, specifically by 
        seeking application for an independent counsel for the campaign 
        finance investigation and related matters; and
            (2) the President should direct the Attorney General to 
        seek application for an independent counsel for the campaign 
        finance investigation and related matters.
