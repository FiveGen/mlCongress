            ``(1) In general.--For purposes of this title, a plan or 
        other arrangement shall not fail to be treated as a cafeteria

        a health flexible spending arrangement under which not more 
        than $500 of unused health benefits may be--
                    ``(A) carried forward to the succeeding plan year 
                of such health flexible spending arrangement, or
                    ``(B) paid to or on behalf of an employee as 
                compensation as of the end of such plan year or upon 
                the termination of, or failure to re-enroll in, such 
                plan or arrangement.
            ``(2) Distribution of unused health benefits on behalf of 
        employee.--For purposes of paragraph (1)(B), unused health 
        benefits paid as compensation on behalf of an employee by the 
        employer shall be--
                    ``(A) includible in gross income and wages of the 
                employee, whether or not a deduction for such payment 
                is allowable under this title to the employee, and
                    ``(B) excludable from--
                            ``(i) gross income to the extent provided 
                        under section 402(e), 457(a) (with respect to

                        457(b)) of an eligible employer described in 
                        section 457(e)(1)(A)), or 220, and

            ``(3) Health flexible spending arrangement.--For purposes 
        of this subsection, the term `health flexible spending 
        arrangement' means a flexible spending arrangement (as defined

        reimbursement for expenses for medical care (as defined in 
        section 213(d)(1) (without regard to subparagraphs (C) and (D) 
        thereof).
            ``(4) Unused health benefits.--For purposes of this 
        subsection, the term `unused health benefits' means the excess 
        of--
                    ``(A) the maximum amount of reimbursement allowable 
                during a plan year under a health flexible spending 
                arrangement, over
                    ``(B) the actual amount of reimbursement during 
                such year under such arrangement.''.
    (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) shall
