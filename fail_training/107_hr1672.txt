                                 A BILL


 
To provide for an increase in funding for research on uterine fibroids 
through the National Institutes of Health, and to provide for a program 
  to provide information and education to the public on such fibroids.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Uterine Fibroids Research and 
Education Act of 2001''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds as follows:
            (1) The development of uterine fibroids is a common and 
        significant health problem, affecting women of all ages, racial 
        backgrounds, and socioeconomic levels.
            (2) It has been estimated that between 20 and 30 percent of 
        women of reproductive age have such fibroids, though not all 
        have been diagnosed. Studies indicate the prevalence could be 
        much higher.
            (3) Uterine fibroids are the most common indication for 
        hysterectomy, accounting for approximately one third of 
        hysterectomies, or 200,000 procedures annually.
            (4) Such fibroids are the leading indication of 
        hysterectomy among premenopausal women in the United States.

SEC. 3. PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAMS REGARDING UTERINE FIBROIDS.

    (a) Research Through National Institutes of Health.--In addition to 
other authorizations of appropriations that are available for the 
purpose of conducting and supporting research on uterine fibroids 
through the National Institutes of Health, there is authorized to be 
appropriated for such purpose $10,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 
2002 through 2006.
    (b) Public Awareness.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services 
        (in this subsection referred to as the ``Secretary'') shall 
        carry out a program to provide information and education to the 
        public regarding uterine fibroids, including information on the 
        incidence and prevalence of such fibroids, and on the elevated 
        risk for minority women.
            (2) Authority for grants and contracts.--The Secretary may 
        carry out paragraph (1) directly or through awards of grants, 
        cooperative agreements, or contracts to public or nonprofit 
        private entities.
            (3) Definition.--For purposes of this subsection, the term 
        ``minority'', with respect to women, means women who are 
        members of racial or ethnic minority groups within the meaning 
        of section 1707 of the Public Health Service Act.
            (4) Authorization of Appropriations.--For the purpose of 
        carrying out this subsection, there are authorized to be 
        appropriated such sums as may be necessary for each of the 
        fiscal years 2002 through 2006. Such authorizations are in 
        addition to any other authorizations of appropriations that are 
        available for such purpose.
                                 <all>
