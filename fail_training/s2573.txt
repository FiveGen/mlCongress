``SEC. 155. PEANUT PROGRAM.

    ``(a) Quota Peanuts.--
            ``(1) In general.--The Secretary shall make nonrecourse 
        loans available to producers of each of the 1999 through 2001 
        crops of quota peanuts.
            ``(2) Disbursement.--The Secretary shall initially disburse 
        only 80 percent of the loans for each of the 1999, 2000, and 
        2001 crops and provide for the disbursement to producers at 
        maturity of any balances due the producers on the loans that 
        may remain to be settled at maturity. The remainder of the 
        loans shall be paid only if payment would result in no net cost 
        to the Commodity Credit Corporation for the immediately 
        preceding and current crops of quota peanuts.
            ``(3) Support rates.--The national average quota support 
        rate for quota peanuts shall not be more than $515 per ton for 
        the 1999 crop, $480 per ton for the 2000 crop, and $445 per ton 
        for the 2001 crop.

        commodity credit corporation.--Any peanuts owned or controlled 
        by the Commodity Credit Corporation may be made available for 
        domestic edible use, in accordance with regulations issued by 
        the Secretary and sales price restrictions applicable to the 
        Corporation.
            ``(6) Location and other factors.--The Secretary may make 
        adjustments for location of peanuts and such other factors as 
        are authorized by section 403.
    ``(b) Additional Peanuts.--The Secretary shall make nonrecourse 
loans available to producers of each of the 1999 through 2001 crops of 
additional peanuts at such levels as the Secretary considers 
appropriate, taking into consideration the demand for peanut oil and 
peanut meal, the expected prices of other vegetable oils and protein 
meals, and the demand for peanuts in foreign markets, except that the 
Secretary shall set the support rate on additional peanuts at a level 
estimated by the Secretary to ensure that there are no losses to the 
Commodity Credit Corporation on the sale or disposal of the peanuts.
    ``(c) Pools for Quota and Additional Peanuts.--
            ``(1) In general.--The Secretary shall require a 
        participating marketing association to establish pools and 
        maintain complete and accurate records by area and segregation 
        for quota peanuts handled under loan and for additional peanuts 
        placed under loan, except that separate pools shall be 
        established for Valencia peanuts produced in New Mexico. Bright 
        hull and dark hull Valencia peanuts shall be considered as 
        separate types for the purpose of establishing the pools.
            ``(2) Net gains.--Net gains on peanuts in each pool, unless 
        otherwise approved by the Secretary, shall be distributed only 
        to producers who placed peanuts in the pool and shall be 
        distributed in proportion to the value of the peanuts placed in 
        the pool by each producer. Net gains for peanuts in each pool 
        shall consist of the net gains over and above the loan 
        indebtedness and other costs or losses incurred on peanuts 
        placed in the pool.
            ``(3) Losses.--A loss in an area quota pool shall be offset 
        by any gain or profit from other area quota pools (other than 
        the quota pool for Valencia peanuts for New Mexico). A quota 
        pool shall be administered at no cost to the Commodity Credit 
        Corporation.
    ``(d) Disapproval of Quotas.--No loan may be made available by the 
Secretary for any crop of peanuts with respect to which poundage quotas 
have been disapproved by producers, as provided for in section 358(c) 
of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 (7 U.S.C. 1358(c)).
    ``(e) Marketing Assessment.--
            ``(1) Definition of first purchaser.--In this subsection, 
        the term `first purchaser' means a person acquiring peanuts 
        from a producer, except that in the case of peanuts forfeited 
        by a producer to the Commodity Credit Corporation, the term 
        means the person acquiring the peanuts from the Commodity 
        Credit Corporation.
            ``(2) Assessment.--The Secretary shall provide, by 
        regulation, for a nonrefundable marketing assessment applicable 
        to each of the 1999 through 2001 crops of peanuts. The 
        assessment shall be made in accordance with this subsection and 
        shall be on a per pound basis in an amount equal to 1.2 percent 
        of the national average quota or additional peanut support rate 
        per pound, as applicable, for the applicable crop. No peanuts 
        shall be assessed more than 1.2 percent of the applicable 
        support rate under this subsection.
            ``(3) First purchasers.--Except as provided under 
        paragraphs (4) and (5), the first purchaser of peanuts shall--
                    ``(A) collect from the producer a marketing 
                assessment equal to the quantity of peanuts acquired 
                multiplied by .65 percent of the applicable national 
                average support rate;
                    ``(B) pay, in addition to the amount collected 
                under subparagraph (A), a marketing assessment in an 
                amount equal to the quantity of peanuts acquired 
                multiplied by .55 percent of the applicable national 
                average support rate; and
                    ``(C) remit the amounts required under 
                subparagraphs (A) and (B) to the Commodity Credit 
                Corporation in a manner specified by the Secretary.
            ``(4) Other private marketings.--In the case of a private 
        marketing by a producer directly to a consumer through a retail 
        or wholesale outlet or in the case of a marketing by the 
        producer outside of the continental United States, the producer 
        shall be responsible for the full amount of the assessment and 
        shall remit the assessment by such time as is specified by the 
        Secretary.
            ``(5) Loan peanuts.--In the case of peanuts that are 
        pledged as collateral for a loan made under this section, \1/2\ 
        of the assessment shall be deducted from the proceeds of the 
        loan. The remainder of the assessment shall be paid by the 
        first purchaser of the peanuts. For the purposes of computing 
        net gains on peanuts under this section, the reduction in loan 
        proceeds shall be treated as having been paid to the producer.
            ``(6) Penalties.--If any person fails to collect or remit 
        the reduction required by this subsection or fails to comply 
        with such requirements for recordkeeping or otherwise as are 
        required by the Secretary to carry out this subsection, the 
        person shall be liable to the Secretary for a civil penalty up 
        to an amount determined by multiplying--
                    ``(A) the quantity of peanuts involved in the 
                violation; by
                    ``(B) the national average quota support rate for 
                the applicable crop year.
