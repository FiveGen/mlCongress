    ``(o) The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the 
Personal Social Security Savings Board, shall estimate and transfer to 
the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund within 3 months 
after the end of each fiscal year an amount equal to the recapture 
amount for such fiscal year. For purposes of the preceding sentence, 
the recapture amount for any fiscal year shall be equal to the amount 
of corporate tax receipts under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 
deposited in the Treasury for that fiscal year which are attributable 
to personal social security savings account investments under part B of

        shall apply with respect to fiscal years beginning after 
        September 30, 2005.
            (3) Initial assumptions.--In determining the recapture 
        amount under section 201(o) of the Social Security Act (added 
        by paragraph (1)) for fiscal years 2006 and 2007, the Secretary 
        of the Treasury shall make the following assumptions concerning 
        the total amount of taxable capital in the United States 
        represented by the total assets held by personal social 
        security savings accounts established under part B of title II 
        of the Social Security Act:
                    (A) 80 percent of such total assets are a net 
                addition to national investments.
                    (B) Of the amount described in subparagraph (A), 90 
                percent will be invested in the United States and 
                subject to taxation under the Internal Revenue Code of 
                1986.
                    (C) Of the amount described in subparagraph (B), 95 
                percent will be subject to the Federal corporate tax.
                    (D) The amount described in subparagraph (C) is 
                subject to the statutory tax rate of 35 percent 
                (resulting in an effective corporate tax rate of 23.9 
                percent on the earnings of all such total assets).
    (b) Recapture of Government Savings Over Baseline.--
            (1) In general.--Section 201 of the Social Security Act (as 
        amended by subsection (a)) is amended further by adding at the

consultation with the Personal Social Security Savings Board, shall 
estimate and transfer to the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance 
Trust Fund within 3 months after the end of each fiscal year an amount 
equal to the spending reductions amount for such fiscal year. For 
purposes of the preceding sentence, the spending reductions amount 
shall be an amount equal to--
            ``(A) for any fiscal year in the period beginning with 
        fiscal year 2006 and ending with fiscal year 2013, the excess

Deficit Control Act of 1985 is amended to read as follows:

``SEC. 256. EXCEPTIONS, LIMITATIONS, AND SPECIAL RULES.

    ``(a) National Wool Act and the Special Milk Program.--Automatic 
spending increases are increases in outlays due to changes in indexes 
in the following programs:

            ``(2) Special milk program.
In those programs all amounts other than the automatic spending 
increases shall be exempt from reduction under any sequestration order.
    ``(b) Student Loans.--For all student loans under part B or D of 
title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 made during the period 
when a sequestration order under section 254 is in effect as required 
by section 252 or 253, origination fees under sections 438(c)(2) and 
455(c) of that Act shall each be increased by 0.50 percentage point.
    ``(c) Foster Care and Adoption Assistance Programs.--Any 
sequestration order shall make the reduction otherwise required under 
the foster care and adoption assistance programs (established by part E

and expenditures made by States in which increases in foster care 
maintenance payment rates or adoption assistance payment rates (or 
both) are to take effect during the fiscal year involved, and only to 
the extent that the required reduction can be accomplished by applying 
a uniform percentage reduction to the Federal matching payments that 
each such State would otherwise receive under section 474 of that Act 
(for such fiscal year) for that portion of the State's payments 
attributable to the increases taking effect during that year. No 
State's matching payments from the Government for foster care 
maintenance payments or for adoption assistance maintenance payments 
may be reduced by a percentage exceeding the applicable domestic 
sequestration percentage. No State may, after the date of the enactment 
of this Act, make any change in the timetable for making payments under 
a State plan approved under part E of title IV of the Social Security 
Act which has the effect of changing the fiscal year in which 
expenditures under such part are made.

States or other entities for the programs listed in paragraph (2) shall 
not be reduced by more than 2 percent under any sequestration order.

reductions shall occur starting with the payment made at the start of 
January. When reduced under a within-session sequestration order, those 
benefit reductions shall occur starting with the next periodic payment.

                            ``(iii) normal production and marketing 
                        relationships among agricultural commodities 
                        (including both contract and non-contract 
                        commodities) are not distorted.
                In meeting the criterion set out in clause (iii) of 
                subparagraph (B) of the preceding sentence, the 
                President shall take into consideration that reductions 
                under an order may apply to programs for two or more 
                agricultural commodities that use the same type of 
                production or marketing resources or that are 
                alternative commodities among which a producer could 
                choose in making annual production decisions.
            ``(5) Certain authority not to be limited.--Nothing in this 
        title shall limit or reduce in any way any appropriation that 
        provides the Commodity Credit Corporation with funds to cover 
        the Corporation's net realized losses.
    ``(n) Postal Service Fund.--Notwithstanding any other provision of 
law, any sequestration of the Postal Service Fund shall be accomplished 
by a payment from that Fund to the General Fund of the Treasury, and 
the Postmaster General of the United States shall make the full amount 
of that payment during the fiscal year to which the presidential 
sequestration order applies.
    ``(o) Effects of Sequestration.--The effects of sequestration shall 
be as follows:
            ``(1) Budgetary resources sequestered from any account 
        other than an entitlement trust, special, or revolving fund 
        account shall revert to the Treasury and be permanently 
        canceled.
            ``(2) Except as otherwise provided, the same percentage 
        sequestration shall apply to all programs, projects, and 
        activities within a budget account (with programs, projects, 
        and activities as delineated in the appropriation Act or 
        accompanying report for the relevant fiscal year covering that 
        account, or for accounts not included in appropriation Acts, as 
        delineated in the most recently submitted President's budget).
            ``(3) Administrative regulations or similar actions 
        implementing a sequestration shall be made within 120 days of 
        the sequestration order. To the extent that formula allocations 
        differ at different levels of budgetary resources within an 
        account, program, project, or activity, the sequestration shall 
        be interpreted as producing a lower total appropriation, with 
        that lower appropriation being obligated as though it had been 
        the pre-sequestration appropriation and no sequestration had 
        occurred.
            ``(4) Except as otherwise provided, obligations in 
        sequestered direct spending accounts shall be reduced in the 
        fiscal year in which a sequestration occurs and in all 
        succeeding fiscal years.
            ``(5) If an automatic spending increase is sequestered, the 
        increase (in the applicable index) that was disregarded as a 
        result of that sequestration shall not be taken into account in 
        any subsequent fiscal year.
            ``(6) Except as otherwise provided, sequestration in 
        accounts for which obligations are indefinite shall be taken in 
        a manner to ensure that obligations in the fiscal year of a 
        sequestration and succeeding fiscal years are reduced, from the 
        level that would actually have occurred, by the applicable 
        sequestration percentage.''.
    (b) Conforming Amendment.--The table of contents set forth in
