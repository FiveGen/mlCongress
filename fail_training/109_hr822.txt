                                 A BILL


 
  To support the establishment or expansion and operation of programs 
  using a network of public and private community entities to provide 
                 mentoring for children in foster care.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Foster Care Mentoring Act of 2005''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Research shows that caring adults can make a difference 
        in children's lives. Forty five percent of mentored teens are 
        less likely to use drugs. Fifty nine percent of mentored teens 
        have better academic performance. Seventy three percent of 
        mentored teens achieve higher goals generally.
            (2) Children that have mentors have better relationships 
        with adults, fewer disciplinary referrals, and more confidence 
        to achieve their goals.
            (3) In 2001, over 163,000 children in the foster care 
        system were under the age of 5 years.
            (4) In 2001, over 124,000 children were under the age of 10 
        when they were removed from their parents or caretakers.
            (5) The International Day of the Child, sponsored by 
        Children United Nations, has served as a great tool to recruit 
        mentors and partner them with needy foster care children.
            (6) On November 10, 2002, as many as 3,000 children will be 
        matched with mentors as a result of the International Day of 
        the Child.
            (7) States should be encouraged to incorporate mentor 
        programs into the delivery of their foster care services. The 
        State of California serves as a great example, matching close 
        to half a million mentors with needy children.
            (8) Mentor programs that serve foster children are unique 
        and require additional considerations including specialized 
        training and support necessary to provide for consistent, long 
        term relationships for children in care.
            (9) Mentor programs are cost-effective approaches to 
        decreasing the occurrence of so many social ills such as teen 
        pregnancy, substance abuse, incarceration and violence.

    Subpart 2 of part B of title IV of the Social Security Act (42 
U.S.C. 629 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:

    ``(a) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this section to authorize the 
Secretary to make grants to eligible applicants to support the 
establishment or expansion and operation of programs using a network of

        managed program in which children are appropriately matched 
        with screened and trained adult volunteers for one-on-one 
        relationships, that involves meetings and activities on a 
        regular basis, and that is intended to meet, in part, the 
        child's need for involvement with a caring and supportive adult 
        who provides a positive role model.
            ``(3) Political subdivision.--The term `political 
        subdivision' means a local jurisdiction below the level of the 
        State government, including a county, parish, borough, or city.
