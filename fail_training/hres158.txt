                               RESOLUTION


 
  To express the support of the House of Representatives for programs 
    such as the Jump$tart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy.

Whereas at a time when more consumers are using credit than ever before, the 
        financial skills of young adults are not adequate to cope with the 
        rapid, technologically driven development of new financial products and 
        new ways to deliver those products;
Whereas lack of financial management skills is a major cause of rising consumer 
        bankruptcies and family crises, and generally impairs the health and 
        welfare of the general public;
Whereas it is critical that students and young adults develop functional skills 
        in money management, including basic budgeting, savings, investing, 
        spending, and income;
Whereas the House of Representatives commends the Jump$tart Coalition for 
        Personal Financial Literacy for its effort to promote personal financial 
        literacy; and
Whereas the House of Representatives supports the Coalition's objective of 
        promoting education to ensure that basic personal management skills are 
        attained during the kindergarten through 12th grade educational 
        experience: Now, therefore, be it
            Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of 
        Representatives that the goal of having young adults who can 
        enter the mainstream of an increasingly complex financial world 
        with confidence and prudence is one which can be advanced 
        through coordinated efforts such as the Jump$tart Coalition for 
        Personal Financial Literacy.
                                 <all>
