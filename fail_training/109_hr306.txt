 To amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to permit local public 
            agencies to act as Medicaid enrollment brokers.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. PERMITTING LOCAL PUBLIC AGENCIES TO ACT AS MEDICAID 
              ENROLLMENT BROKERS.

    Section 1903(b)(4) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 
1396b(b)(4)) is amended by adding at the end the following new 
subparagraph:
            ``(C)(i) Subparagraphs (A) and (B) shall not apply in the 
        case of a local public agency that is acting as an enrollment 
        broker under a contract or memorandum with a State medicaid 
        agency, provided the local public agency does not have a direct 
        or indirect financial interest with any medicaid managed care 
        plan for which it provides enrollment broker services.
            ``(ii) In determining whether a local public agency has a 
        direct or indirect financial interest with a medicaid managed 
        care plan under clause (i), the status of a local public agency 
        as a contractor of the plan does not constitute having a direct 
        or indirect financial interest with the plan.''.
                                 <all>
