        person's actions are the commission of a crime; and
            ``(2) any of the following circumstances is present:
                    ``(A) The officer has reasonable basis for 
                believing that continued domestic violence against the 
                alleged victim is likely.
                    ``(B) There is evidence of physical injury to the 
                alleged victim.
                    ``(C) The use of a deadly weapon or dangerous 
                instrument is evident.
    ``(b) Domestic Violence.--In this section, the term `domestic 
violence' means any of the following engaged in by a person against the 
person's spouse or former spouse or against a person with whom the 
person resides or formerly resided or against an individual with whom 
the person has a child in common:

        witnesses concerning the alleged domestic violence; and
            ``(3) a statement that a copy of legal rights and notices 
        was given to the victim.
    ``(d) Law Enforcement Policies.--(1) The Secretary of Defense shall 
prescribe regulations to implement written policies regarding arrest 
procedures for domestic violence incidents. Those policies shall 
include the following:
            ``(A) In most circumstances, a military law enforcement 
        officer should arrest and take a person into custody if the 
        officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the person is 
        committing or has committed domestic violence and that the 
        actions constitute the commission of a crime.
            ``(B) When the officer has reasonable grounds to believe 
        that the spouses or former spouses or other persons who reside 
        together or resided together or share a child in common are 
        committing or have committed domestic violence against each 
        other, the officer does not have to arrest both parties but 
        should arrest the person whom the officer believes to be the 
        primary physical aggressor. In determining who is the primary 
        physical aggressor, an officer should consider the intent of 
        this section to protect victims of domestic violence, the 
        relative injury or fear inflicted on the persons involved, and 
        any history of domestic violence between those persons, if that 
        history can be ascertained by the officer, or response of a 
        person who acts in a reasonable manner to protect oneself or 
        another family or household member from domestic violence. No 
        victim shall be denied relief or charged for a domestic 
        violence offense because the victim used reasonable force in 
        self defense against domestic violence by an attacker.
            ``(C) The decision of a military law enforcement officer as 
        to whether or not to make an arrest under this section may not 
        be based on the consent of the victim or any subsequent 
        prosecution or on the relationship or the rank of the persons 
        involved in the incident.
            ``(D) A decision of a military law enforcement officer's 
        decision not to arrest under this section may not be based 
        solely upon the absence of visible injury or impairment.
    ``(2) The policies under paragraph (1) shall include a procedure 
applicable to the report and referral required under subsection (c). 
Such procedures shall require that the military law enforcement agency 
shall, without charge, send a copy of the initial report and any 
subsequent, supplemental, or related report, which excludes the 
victim's statement or other materials that are part of an active 
criminal investigation and are exempt from disclosure, to the command 
and Family Advocacy Program exercising responsibility over the area in 
which the incident took place, to the victim advocate within the 
Department of Defense assigned to the installation and the nearest 
local domestic violence center within 24 hours of the agency's receipt

    (c) Confidentiality.--The Secretary shall ensure the 
confidentiality of each survey participant.

within the Armed Forces.
    (e) Report.--Not later than 24 months after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to Congress a report 
providing the results of the study under this section. The report shall 
include the following:

            (2) A discussion of the legal, judicial, nonjudicial, and 
        rehabilitative responses to child maltreatment, abuse, suicide, 
        and homicide and how those responses vary across the services.
            (3) The extent to which such responses are effective at 
        ensuring victim safety, requiring offender accountability, and 
        imposing sanctions on the offender.
            (4) A review of the availability, accessibility, and 
        effectiveness at increasing victim safety within the existing 
        prevention and intervention programs available to victims of 
        child maltreatment, abuse, suicide, and homicide within the 
        Armed Forces.
            (5) Recommendations for a comprehensive strategy for 
        prevention and intervention in cases of child maltreatment, 
        abuse, suicide, and homicide.
