                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
 Concerning the Palestinian Authority and the sale of land to Israelis.

Whereas the Palestinian Authority Justice Minister Freih Abu Medein announced 
        last month that anyone selling land to Jews was committing a crime 
        punishable by death;
Whereas since this announcement three Palestinian individuals were murdered in 
        the Jerusalem and Ramallah areas for, what would anywhere else in the 
        world be considered normal business activity--selling real estate;
Whereas recently Israeli police managed to foil the attempted abduction of a 
        fourth person;
Whereas Israeli security services have acquired evidence indicating the 
        intelligence service of the Palestinian Authority were directly involved 
        in at least two of these murders;
Whereas subsequent statements by high-ranking Palestinian Authority officials 
        have justified these murders which have further encouraged this 
        intolerable policy;
Whereas the Palestinian Authority has failed to condemn the policy of murdering 
        people for business transactions;
Whereas this policy is in direct contravention to the peace agreements already 
        reached between the Palestinian Authority and the State of Israel; and
Whereas credible evidence exists that the Palestinian Authority has played an 
        active role in these murders and in enforcing this policy: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring), 
That it is the sense of the Congress that--
            (1) the Clinton administration should thoroughly 
        investigate the Palestinian Authority role in enforcing this 
        racist policy and should immediately report to the Congress its 
        findings;
            (2) the Palestinian Authority, with Yasser Arafat as its 
        chairman, must immediately issue a public and unequivocal 
        statement denouncing these acts and this policy;
            (3) this policy is an affront to all those who place high 
        value on peace and basic human rights; and
            (4) the United States should not provide foreign assistance 
        to the Palestinian Authority until this policy is reversed.
                                 <all>
