   victory in the 2005 Tour de France and retiring from professional 
                                cycling.

Whereas Lance Armstrong won the 2005 Tour de France bicycle race, completing the 
        2,254-mile, 21-day race in 86 hours, 15 minutes, and 2 seconds, 
        finishing 4 minutes and 40 seconds ahead of his nearest competitor;
Whereas Lance Armstrong's win on July 24, 2005, in Paris, was his 7th 
        consecutive victory of the Tour de France and extended the record for 
        consecutive wins that he already held;
Whereas Lance Armstrong displayed incredible perseverance, determination, and 
        leadership to prevail over the mountainous terrain of the Alps and 
        Pyrenees, the vast stretches of countryside, and the numerous city 
        streets that comprise the course of the premier cycling event in the 
        world;
Whereas in addition to his Tour de France victories, Lance Armstrong has won 
        several major bicycle races, including the World Road Race Championship, 
        the Tour de Georgia, the Dauphne Libre, and the Tour of Switzerland and 
        placed highly in the Paris-Nice, the Liege-Bastogne-Liege, and the World 
        Time Trail Championship;
Whereas Lance Armstrong is acclaimed and accomplished in multiple disciplines of 
        cycling;
Whereas Lance Armstrong is the first cancer survivor to win the Tour de France;
Whereas in 1997, Lance Armstrong defeated choriocarcinoma, an aggressive form of 
        testicular cancer that had spread throughout his abdomen, lungs, and 
        brain, and after treatment has remained cancer-free for the past 8 
        years;
Whereas Lance Armstrong's bravery and resolution to overcome cancer have made 
        him a role model to cancer patients and their loved ones, and his 
        efforts through the Lance Armstrong Foundation have helped to advance 
        cancer research, diagnosis, treatment, and after-treatment services;
Whereas Lance Armstrong has been vital to the promotion of cycling as a sport, a 
        healthy fitness activity, and a pollution-free transportation 
        alternative;
Whereas Lance Armstrong's accomplishments as an athlete, teammate, cancer 
        survivor, and advocate have made him an American hero; and
Whereas, upon winning the 2005 Tour de France, Lance Armstrong is retiring from 
        professional cycling: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--

        cancer and for his unwavering commitment to cancer awareness;
