To prohibit the relocation of certain Marine Corps helicopter aircraft 
               to Naval Air Station Miramar, California.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. PROHIBITION ON RELOCATION OF CERTAIN MARINE CORPS HELICOPTER 
              AIRCRAFT TO NAVAL AIR STATION MIRAMAR, CALIFORNIA.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The plan developed by the Secretary of the Navy to 
        relocate helicopter aircraft from Marine Corps Air Station El 
        Toro, California, and from Marine Corps Air Station Tustin, 
        California, to Naval Air Station Miramar, California, is widely 
        opposed by the community in the vicinity of Naval Air Station 
        Miramar.
            (2) Community organizations in the community that oppose 
        the relocation plan have filed lawsuits to block the plan, 
        alleging that the Secretary failed to comply with the 
        provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and 
        the Clean Air Act in developing the plan.
            (3) Other military installations in southern California 
        provide suitable basing alternatives for the helicopter 
        aircraft covered by the plan.
    (b) Prohibition.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no 
funds appropriated or otherwise made available for the Department of 
Defense may be obligated or expended to relocate the rotary-wing 
aircraft referred to in subsection (c) to Naval Air Station Miramar, 
California.
    (c) Covered Aircraft.--Subsection (b) applies to the following:
            (1) Any rotary-wing aircraft assigned (as of the date of 
        enactment of this Act) to the following Marine Corps units:
                    (A) Squadrons 161, 163, 164, 361, 462, 465, and 
                466, 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing.
                    (B) Squadron 764, 4th Marine Reserve Aircraft Wing.
            (2) Any rotary-wing aircraft of the Marine Corps available 
        for relocation to Naval Air Station Miramar as a result of the 
        relocation to a location other than Naval Air Station Miramar 
        of the aircraft referred to in paragraph (1).
