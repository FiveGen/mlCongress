                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
To provide that the statue of Roger Williams be returned to the United 
 States Capitol Rotunda at the conclusion of the temporary display of 
the Portrait Monument of Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, and 
                             Lucretia Mott.

Whereas Roger Williams was the primary architect of the lively 
        experiment of church-state separation as the necessary 
        corollary of religious liberty;
Whereas Roger Williams was an ardent advocate of the legal rights of 
        Native Americans, maintained a close friendship with them and 
        purchased land from them;
Whereas Roger Williams may also be seen as the first European 
        environmentalist on this continent; and
Whereas Roger Williams was the founder of the first Baptist church in 
        America and the founder of the first Baptist denomination in 
        this hemisphere: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring), 
That the statue of Roger Williams shall be returned to the United 
States Capitol Rotunda at the conclusion of the temporary display of 
the Suffragists Portrait Monument.
                                 <all>
