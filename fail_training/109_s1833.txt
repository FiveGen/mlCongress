SEC. 2. HEALTH OPPORTUNITY ACCOUNTS UNDER THE MEDICAID PROGRAM.

    Title XIX of the Social Security Act is amended--
            (1) by redesignating section 1936 as section 1937; and
            (2) by inserting after section 1935 the following new 
        section:

                     ``health opportunity accounts

    ``Sec. 1936. (a) Authority.--
            ``(1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of 
        this title, the Secretary shall establish a demonstration 
        program under which States may provide under their State plans 
        under this title (including such a plan operating under a 
        statewide waiver under section 1115) in accordance with this 
        section for the provision of alternative benefits consistent 
        with subsection (c) for eligible population groups in one or 
        more geographic areas of the State specified by the State. An 
        amendment under the previous sentence is referred to in this 
        section as a `State demonstration program'.
            ``(2) Initial demonstration.--The demonstration program 
        under this section shall begin on January 1, 2006. During the 
        first 5 years of such program, the Secretary shall not approve 
        more than 10 State demonstration programs, with each State 
        demonstration program covering one or more geographic areas 
        specified by the State. After such 5-year period--
                    ``(A) unless the Secretary finds, taking into 
                account cost-effectiveness, quality of care, and other 
                criteria that the Secretary specifies, that a State 
                demonstration program previously implemented has been 
                unsuccessful, such a demonstration program may be 
                extended or made permanent in the State; and
                    ``(B) unless the Secretary finds, taking into 
                account cost-effectiveness, quality of care, and other 
                criteria that the Secretary specifies, that all State 
                demonstration programs previously implemented were 
                unsuccessful, other States may implement State 
                demonstration programs.
            ``(3) Approval.--The Secretary shall not approve a State 
        demonstration program under paragraph (1) unless the program 
        incorporates the following:
                    ``(A) Creating patient awareness of the high cost 
                of medical care.
                    ``(B) Providing incentives to patients to seek 
                preventive care services.
                    ``(C) Reducing inappropriate use of health care 
                services.
                    ``(D) Enabling patients to take responsibility for 
                health outcomes.
                    ``(E) Providing enrollment counselors and ongoing 
                education activities.
                    ``(F) Providing transactions involving health 
                opportunity accounts to be conducted electronically and 
                without cash.
                    ``(G) Providing access to negotiated provider 
                payment rates consistent with this section.
        Nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing a 
        State demonstration program from providing incentives for 
        patients obtaining appropriate preventive care (as defined for 
        purposes of section 223(c)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code 
        of 1986), such as additional account contributions for an 
        individual demonstrating healthy prevention practices.
            ``(4) No requirement for statewideness.--Nothing in this 
        section or any other provision of law shall be construed to 
        require that a State must provide for the implemention of a 
        State demonstration program on a Statewide basis.
            ``(5) Reports.--The Secretary shall periodically submit to 
        Congress reports regarding the success of State demonstration 
        programs.
    ``(b) Eligible Population Groups.--
            ``(1) In general.--A State demonstration program under this 
        section shall specify the eligible population groups consistent 
        with paragraph (2).
            ``(2) Eligibility limitations during initial demonstration 
        period.--During the initial 5 years of the demonstration 
        program under this section, a State demonstration project shall 
        not apply to any of the following individuals:
                    ``(A) Individuals who are 65 years of age or older.
                    ``(B) Individuals who are disabled, regardless of 
                whether or not their eligibility for medical assistance 
                under this title is based on such disability.
                    ``(C) Individuals who are eligible for medical 
                assistance under this title only because they are (or 
                were within the previous 60 days) pregnant.
                    ``(D) Individuals who have been eligible for 
                medical assistance for a continuous period of less than 
                3 months.
            ``(3) Limitations.--
                    ``(A) State option.--This subsection shall not be 
                construed as preventing a State from further limiting 
                eligibility to individuals who are likely to be 
                eligible for medical assistance for a period of one 
                year or longer.
                    ``(B) On enrollees in medicaid managed care 
                organizations.--Insofar as the State provides for 
                eligibility of individuals who are enrolled in medicaid 
                managed care organizations, such individuals may 
                participate in the State demonstration project only if 
                the State provides assurances satisfactory to the 
                Secretary that the following conditions are met with 
                respect to any such organization:
                            ``(i) In no case may the number of such 
                        individuals enrolled in the organization who 
                        participate in the project exceed 5 percent of 
                        the total number of individuals enrolled in 
                        such organization.
                            ``(ii) The proportion of enrollees in the 
                        organization who so participate is not 
                        significantly disproportionate to the 
                        proportion of such enrollees in other such 
                        organizations who participate.
                            ``(iii) The State has provided for an 
                        appropriate adjustment in the per capita 
                        payments to the organization to account for 
                        such participation, taking into account 
                        differences in the likely use of health 
                        services between enrollees who so participate 
                        and enrollees who do not so participate.
            ``(4) Voluntary participation.--An eligible individual 
        shall be enrolled in a State demonstration project only if the 
        individual voluntarily enrolls. Such an enrollment shall be 
        effective for a period of 12 months, but may be extended for 
        additional periods of 12 months each with the consent of the 
        individual.
    ``(c) Alternative Benefits.--
            ``(1) In general.--The alternative benefits provided under 
        this section shall consist, consistent with this subsection, of 
        at least--

                items and services for which benefits are otherwise 
                provided under this title after an annual deductible 
                described in paragraph (2) has been met; and
                    ``(B) contribution into a health opportunity 
                account.

        State from providing for coverage of preventive care (referred 
        to in subsection (a)(3)) within the alternative benefits 
        without regard to the annual deductible.
            ``(2) Annual deductible.--The amount of the annual 
        deductible described in paragraph (1)(A) shall be at least 100 
        percent, but no more than 110 percent, of the annualized amount 
        of contributions to the health opportunity account under 
        subsection (d)(2)(A)(i), determined without regard to any 
        limitation described in subsection (d)(2)(C)(ii).

                demonstration project medicaid services from any 
                provider under such organization at payment rates that 
                do not exceed the payment rate that would be applicable 
                to such services if the deductible described in 
                paragraph (1)(A) was not applicable.
