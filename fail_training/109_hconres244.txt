                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing the sense of the Congress that the United States should 
expand trade opportunities with Mongolia by initiating negotiations to 
            enter into a free trade agreement with Mongolia.

Whereas Mongolia rejected 1-party Communist rule and embarked on democratic and 
        free-market reforms in 1990;
Whereas these reforms included privatizing state enterprises, lifting price 
        controls, and instituting fiscal discipline;
Whereas presidential and legislative elections have been held, with extremely 
        high voter turnout, since 1996;
Whereas Mongolia remains steadfastly committed to greater economic reforms;
Whereas Mongolia has been a member of the World Trade Organization since 1997;
Whereas in 1999 the United States provided permanent normal trade relations 
        treatment to the products of Mongolia;
Whereas the United States and Mongolia signed a bilateral Trade and Investment 
        Framework Agreement (TIFA) in 2004;
Whereas bilateral trade between the United States and Mongolia in 2004 was 
        valued at more than $267,000,000;
Whereas Mongolia has been an early political and logistical supporter of the 
        global war on terror, contributing troops, engineers, and medical 
        personnel to Operation Iraqi Freedom since April 2003, offering 
        overflight clearances for United States forces, and participating in 
        training artillery units of the Afghan National Army;
Whereas on August 6, 2002, the President signed into law H.R. 3009 (Public Law 
        107-210), the Trade Act of 2002, which provides for an expedited 
        procedure for congressional consideration of international trade 
        agreements; and
Whereas workers, consumers, business owners, and investors benefit substantially 
        from expanding and diversifying trade opportunities by reducing tariff 
        and nontariff barriers to trade: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That it is the sense of the Congress that the United States should 
expand trade opportunities with Mongolia by initiating negotiations to 
enter into a free trade agreement with Mongolia.
