 Urging the establishment and observation of a legal public holiday in 
                       honor of Cesar E. Chavez.

Whereas Cesar E. Chavez was born March 31, 1927, on a small farm near Yuma, 
        Arizona, and died on April 23, 1993;
Whereas numerous holidays, schools, parks, libraries, and other structures and 
        events have been named after Cesar E. Chavez, in the United States and 
        internationally, with many more planned;
Whereas Cesar E. Chavez was a recipient of the Martin Luther King Jr. Peace 
        Prize during his lifetime and was awarded the Presidential Medal of 
        Freedom on August 8, 1994;
Whereas Cesar E. Chavez was the grandson of a Mexican immigrant and settler and 
        grew up working with migrant farm workers, picking grapes, melons, 
        beans, and other crops at low wages and for long hours, during which 
        time he developed a strong work ethic and respect for the farm workers 
        his father called ``the children of God'';
Whereas at the age of 18, Cesar E. Chavez entered the United States Navy and 
        served his country with distinction for two years;
Whereas, as early as 1949, Cesar E. Chavez committed himself to organizing farm 
        workers to campaign for safe and fair working conditions, reasonable 
        wages, decent housing, and the outlawing of child labor;
Whereas in 1962, Cesar E. Chavez founded the National Farm Workers Association, 
        predecessor of the United Farm Workers of America, which brought hope to 
        farm workers that they might one day realize the basic protections and 
        workers' rights to which all Americans aspire;
Whereas, through his commitment to nonviolence, Cesar E. Chavez brought dignity 
        and respect to the farm workers who organized themselves, and became an 
        inspiration and a resource to other Americans and people engaged in 
        human rights struggles throughout the world;
Whereas Cesar E. Chavez was an advocate for nonviolence at a time when violence 
        penetrated every level of our society;
Whereas Cesar E. Chavez and his family also dedicated themselves to the 
        education of farm workers' children through migrant schools, many of 
        whom graduated and worked as teachers, doctors, or nurses or in other 
        professional occupations;
Whereas the legacy of Cesar E. Chavez includes healthy working conditions that 
        yield uncontaminated food for America's tables;
Whereas Cesar E. Chavez's influence extends far beyond agriculture and provides 
        inspiration for those working to better human rights through his example 
        of organizing voter registration drives in urban and farm areas, 
        initiating complaints against mistreatment by police and welfare 
        officials, and empowering workers to seek advancement in education and 
        politics;
Whereas Cesar E. Chavez lived alongside his campesino brothers and sisters in 
        humble surroundings;
Whereas, upon his death in 1993, Cesar E. Chavez was laid to rest where he lived 
        and worked for 23 years on the grounds of the headquarters of the United 
        Farm Workers of America, known as Nuestra Senora de La Paz (Our Lady of 
        Peace), located in the Tehachapi Mountains at Keene, California; and
Whereas the United States should not cease its efforts to improve the conditions 
        of farm workers, remembering the rallying cry of Cesar E. Chavez, ``Si 
        se puede!'' (There is Hope!): Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved,  That, the House of Representatives recognizes the 
accomplishments and example of Cesar E. Chavez and urges--
            (1) the Congress to amend section 6103 of title 5, United 
        States Code, or the President to issue an Executive order to 
        establish a legal public holiday in honor of Cesar E. Chavez;
            (2) the several States, the District of Columbia, the 
        Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and territories and possessions of 
        the United States to observe the date established as Cesar E. 
        Chavez Day as a public holiday; and
            (3) public elementary and secondary schools in the United 
        States to enhance understanding of Cesar E. Chavez Day by 
        providing classroom instruction on the life and work of Cesar 
        E. Chavez.
