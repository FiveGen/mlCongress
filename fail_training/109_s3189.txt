  To allow for the renegotiation of the payment schedule of contracts 
  between the Secretary of the Interior and the Redwood Valley County 
                Water District, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. RENEGOTIATION OF PAYMENT SCHEDULE.

    Section 15 of Public Law 100-516 (102 Stat. 2573) is amended as 
follows:
            (1) By amending paragraph (2) of subsection (a) to read as 
        follows:
            ``(2) If, as of January 1, 2006, the Secretary of the 
        Interior and the Redwood Valley County Water District have not 
        renegotiated the schedule of payment, the District may enter 
        into such additional non-Federal obligations as are necessary 
        to finance procurement of dedicated water rights and 
        improvements necessary to store and convey those rights to 
        provide for the District's water needs. The renegotiated 
        schedule of payments shall commence when such additional 
        obligations have been financially satisfied by the District. 
        The date of the initial payment owed by the District to the 
        United States shall be regarded as the start of the District's 
        repayment period and the time upon which any interest shall 
        first be computed and assessed under section 5 of the Small 
        Reclamation Projects Act of 1956 (43 U.S.C. 422a et seq.).''.
            (2) By striking subsection (c).
                                 <all>
