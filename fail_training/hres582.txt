                               RESOLUTION


 
 Directing the Committee on the Judiciary to undertake an inquiry into 
   whether grounds exist to impeach Kenneth W. Starr, an independent 
                    prosecutor of the United States.

Whereas Mr. Kenneth Starr, an independent counsel of the United States, has 
        conducted a 4-year $40,000,000 investigation which has yielded little of 
        substantive value;
Whereas he leaked grand jury testimony;
Whereas he intimidated witnesses;
Whereas he built a case based on tape recordings which had been both taped 
        illegally and tampered with; and
Whereas he provided Congress with a 1-sided report of his 4-year investigation: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Committee on the Judiciary is directed to 
investigate and report to the House whether grounds exist to impeach 
Kenneth W. Starr. Upon completion of such investigation, the Committee 
shall report to the House its recommendations with respect thereto, 
including, if the Committee so determines, a resolution of impeachment.
                                 <all>
