                            JOINT RESOLUTION


 
   Recognizing the authority of public schools to allow students to 
 exercise their constitutional rights by establishing a period of time 
    for silent prayer or meditation or reflection, encouraging the 
 recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance, and refusing to discriminate 
 against individuals or groups on account of their religious character 
                               or speech.

Whereas in each public school classroom, the teacher in charge may set aside a 
        period of time, which students may use for silent prayer or meditation 
        or reflection, a period that is not intended to be and shall not be set 
        aside as a religious service or exercise, but shall be considered as an 
        opportunity for silent prayer or meditation or reflection;
Whereas public schools have the responsibility to foster love of country by 
        allowing students the opportunity to exercise their right to recite the 
        Pledge of Allegiance each day; and
Whereas public schools, in evaluating requests for use of public school 
        facilities during noninstructional time and requests for other 
        privileges, may not discriminate against individuals or groups on 
        account of their religious character or speech: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Resolution may be cited as the ``Students' Rights Resolution 
of 2001''.

SEC. 2. STUDENTS' RIGHTS RESOLUTION.

    (a) Recognition of Constitutional Rights.--Congress recognizes the 
right, as established by the Constitution and upheld by the Supreme 
Court, of all Americans to freely exercise their religion.
    (b) Recognition of Students' Rights.--Congress recognizes the 
constitutional right of students in public schools to participate in a 
daily period of time to be used for silent prayer or meditation or 
reflection and to recite the Pledge of Allegiance; and the right of 
religious groups to have equal access to school facilities without 
discrimination on account of religious character or speech.
    (c) Protection of Students' Rights.--It is the sense of Congress 
that public schools should act to protect these constitutional rights 
by establishing a period of time for silent prayer or meditation or 
reflection, establishing a recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance, and 
accommodating religious groups by granting equal access rather than 
discriminating on account of their religious character or speech.
                                 <all>
