        CHAPTER 3--RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TAX CREDIT EXTENSION

SEC. 1131. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Research and development performed in the United States 
        results in quality jobs, better and safer products, increased 
        ownership of technology-based intellectual property, and higher 
        productivity in the United States.
            (2) Since 1994, private sector research and development 
        employment has grown at a faster rate than overall private 
        sector employment in the United States. From 1994 to 2000, 
        there was an average annual growth rate of 5.4 percent in 
        research and development employment, compared with 2.7 percent 
        in total employment.
            (3) The extent to which companies perform and increase 
        research and development activities in the United States is in 
        part dependent on Federal tax policy.
            (4) The private sector performed most of the Nation's 
        research and development and accounted for more than two-thirds 
        of total research and development performance in 2003. Of the 
        $194,000,000,000 in industrial research and development 
        performed in 2003, more than 90 percent was funded by industry.
            (5) Many of the countries with which the United States 
        competes have introduced new or revised national plans for 
        science, technology, and innovation policy, and a growing 
        number of countries have established targets for increased 
        research and development spending. Virtually all countries are 
        seeking ways to enhance the quality and efficiency of public 
        research, stimulate business investments in research and 
        development, and strengthen linkages between the public and 
        private sectors.
            (6) Direct government support to business research and 
        development has declined, both in absolute terms and as a share 
        of business research and development, and greater emphasis is 
        being placed on indirect measures, such as tax incentives for 
        research and development.
            (7) Congress should make permanent a research and 
        development credit that provides a meaningful incentive to all 
        types of taxpayers.

                            ``(i) Taxpayers to which subparagraph 
                        applies.--The credit under this paragraph shall 
                        be determined under this subparagraph if the

                        taxable year for which the credit is being 
                        determined.
                            ``(ii) Credit rate.--The credit determined 
                        under this subparagraph shall be equal to 6 
                        percent of the qualified research expenses for 
                        the taxable year.
                    ``(C) Election.--An election under this paragraph 
                shall apply to the taxable year for which made and all 
                succeeding taxable years unless revoked with the

                paragraph may not be made for any taxable year to which 
                an election under paragraph (4) applies.''.
    (b) Coordination With Election of Alternative Incremental Credit.--

            CHAPTER 1--CREATING A NATIONAL BROADBAND POLICY

SEC. 1311. NATIONAL BROADBAND POLICY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds as follows:
            (1) In 2004, President George W. Bush declared that the 
        United States should have ``universal, affordable access for 
        broadband technology by 2007''.
            (2) Instead, the United States has fallen to 16th in global 
        rankings of broadband penetration, behind South Korea, Japan, 
        and urban China.
            (3) The United Sates is the only G7 nation without a 
        national broadband policy.
            (4) Economists assert that widespread adoption of basic 
        broadband could add $500,000,000,000 to the economy of the 
        United States and create 1,200,000 new jobs.
    (b) Broadband Policy.--
            (1) Responsibility of president's council of advisors on 
        science and technology.--

                            (i) establish a national broadband policy 
                        for improving and expanding broadband access in 
                        the United States by 2010; and
                            (ii) develop a strategy and make 
                        recommendations to the President and Congress 
                        on how to best achieve such policy.

        date shall be a ratable portion of the credit otherwise 
        determined based on the portion of the 3-month period during

       TITLE II--EDUCATE AMERICANS TO FILL THE JOBS OF THE FUTURE

SEC. 2001. SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``New National Defense Education 
Act''.

SEC. 2002. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Throughout our Nation's history, the skills and 
        education of our workforce have been a major determinant of the 
        standard of living of the people of the United States.
            (2) Spurred into action by the launch of Sputnik, Congress 
        passed the National Defense Education Act of 1958 (Public Law 
        85-864, 72 Stat. 1580). The law, now nearly 50 years old, 
        declared a national ``educational emergency'', and Federal 
        expenditures for education more than doubled in the 4 years 
        after its passage. The programs authorized under the Act helped 
        the United States to improve rapidly in mathematics, science, 
        engineering, technology, and foreign languages and led to our 
        dominance in the arms race and the global economy.
            (3) Today, our Nation once again faces an international 
        challenge in education: we must confront a shortage of highly 
        skilled and educated workers, especially in mathematics, 
        science, engineering, technology, and critical-need foreign 
        languages. As a percentage of total first university degrees 
        granted, the United States produced fewer graduates in 
        mathematics, science, and engineering in 2002 than the Nation 
        did in 1985. Currently, the United States Government requires 
        34,000 employees with foreign language skills in 100 languages 
        across more than 80 Federal agencies. These trends pose a 
        threat to our national security and our economic security.
            (4) Student achievement in mathematics and science in 
        elementary school and secondary school lags behind other 
        nations, according to the Trends in International Mathematics 
        and Science study and other studies, including the Programme 
        for International Student Assessment, that recently ranked 
        United States secondary school students 28th out of 40 first- 
        and second-world nations, and tied with Latvia, in mathematics 
        performance and problem solving.
            (5) According to the most recent National Assessment of 
        Educational Progress, less than 40 percent of the students in 
        grade 4 and 30 percent of the students in grade 8, and only 17 
        percent of the students in grade 12, reach the proficient level 
        in mathematics, and approximately \1/3\ of the students in 
        grades 4 and 8, and nearly \1/2\ of the students in grade 12, 
        do not reach the basic level in science.
            (6) A State-by-State comparison of the 2005 National 
        Assessment of Educational Progress average scale scores for 8th 
        grade mathematics reveals that 31 States--more than \1/2\ of 
        the States in the Nation--scored more than 10 points (about 1 
        grade level) below the highest scoring State, Massachusetts.
            (7) More than 200,000,000 children in China are studying 
        English, a compulsory subject for all Chinese primary school 
        students. By comparison, only about 24,000 of approximately 
        54,000,000 elementary and secondary school children in the 
        United States are studying Chinese.
            (8) There is a significant shortage of trained and 
        qualified mathematics and science teachers in the United 
        States. According to the National Science Board, in 2002, 
        between 17 and 28 percent of public secondary school science 
        teachers (depending on the specific scientific field), and 20 
        percent of public secondary school mathematics teachers, lacked 
        full certification in their teaching field.
            (9) More than \1/2\ of the 20 fastest growing occupations 
        require postsecondary degrees in mathematics or science. 
        According to the National Science Board, out of more than 
        15,000,000 college students, less than 400,000 Americans a year 
        graduate with a bachelor's degree in mathematics, science, 
        engineering, or technology. According to the National Science 
        Foundation, only 75,000 American undergraduate students obtain 
        a master's degree in mathematics, science, engineering, or 
        technology.
            (10) In a 2002 Government Accountability Office report, the 
        United States Army reported that it was experiencing serious 
        shortfalls of translators and interpreters in 5 of its 6 
        critical languages: Arabic, Korean, Mandarin Chinese, Persian-
        Farsi, and Russian. According to the Modern Language 
        Association, enrollment in foreign languages declined from 16 
        percent of college students in 1965 to 8 percent in 1974, 
        rebounding to just 8.6 percent in 2002. Less commonly taught 
        languages accounted for only 12 percent of all language 
        enrollments. This means that 1 percent of American 
        undergraduate students are studying these critical languages.
            (11) In 2002, 79 percent of Americans agreed that students 
        should have a study-abroad experience sometime during college. 
        Only 1 percent of all United States undergraduate students 
        studied abroad in the 2001-2002 school year.
            (12) The Government Accountability Office estimates that 
        the number of students enrolled in science, technology, 
        engineering, or mathematics doctoral degree programs at United 
        States institutions of higher education declined from 217,395 
        during the 1995-1996 academic year to 198,504 during the 2003-
        2004 academic year.
            (13) The extent of this crisis requires a coordinated 
        Federal response and an increased Federal investment in 
        programs of the Department of Education and the National 
        Science Foundation.

    (a) TEACH Grants.--Title II of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 
U.S.C. 1021 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:

                         ``PART C--TEACH GRANTS

``SEC. 231. PURPOSES.

    ``The purposes of this part are--
            ``(1) to improve student academic achievement;
            ``(2) to help recruit and prepare teachers to meet the 
        national demand for a highly qualified teacher in every 
        classroom; and
            ``(3) to increase opportunities for Americans of all 
        educational, ethnic, class, and geographic backgrounds to 
        become highly qualified teachers.

``SEC. 232. PROGRAM ESTABLISHED.

    ``(a) Program Authority.--
            ``(1) Payments required.--For each of the fiscal years 2007 
        through 2014, the Secretary shall pay to each eligible 
        institution of higher education such sums as may be necessary 
        to pay to each eligible student (defined in accordance with 
        section 484) who files an application and agreement in 
        accordance with section 233, and qualifies under subsection 
        (a)(2) of such section, a TEACH Grant in the amount of $7,000 
        for each academic year during which that student is in 
        attendance at an institution of higher education.
            ``(2) Reference.--Grants made under this part shall be 
        known as `Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher 
        Education Grants' or `TEACH Grants'.
    ``(b) Payment Methodology.--
            ``(1) Prepayment.--Not less than 85 percent of such sums 
        shall be advanced to eligible institutions prior to the start 
        of each payment period and shall be based upon an amount 
        requested by the institution as needed to pay eligible students 
        until such time as the Secretary determines and publishes in 
        the Federal Register with an opportunity for comment, an 
        alternative payment system that provides payments to 
        institutions in an accurate and timely manner, except that this 
        sentence shall not be construed to limit the authority of the 
        Secretary to place an institution on a reimbursement system of 
        payment.
            ``(2) Direct payment.--Nothing in this section shall be 
        interpreted to prohibit the Secretary from paying directly to 
        students, in advance of the beginning of the academic term, an 
        amount for which they are eligible, in cases where the eligible 
        institution elects not to participate in the disbursement 
        system required by paragraph (1).
            ``(3) Distribution of grants to students.--Payments under 
        this part shall be made, in accordance with regulations 
        promulgated by the Secretary for such purpose, in such manner 
        as will best accomplish the purposes of this part. Any 
        disbursement allowed to be made by crediting the student's 
        account shall be limited to tuition and fees and, in the case 
        of institutionally owned housing, room and board. The student 
        may elect to have the institution provide other such goods and 
        services by crediting the student's account.
    ``(c) Reductions in Amount.--
            ``(1) Part-time students.--In any case where a student 
        attends an institution of higher education on less than a full-
        time basis (including a student who attends an institution of 
        higher education on less than a half-time basis) during any 
        academic year, the amount of the TEACH Grant for which that 
        student is eligible shall be reduced in proportion to the 
        degree to which that student is not so attending on a full-time 
        basis, in accordance with a schedule of reductions established 
        by the Secretary for the purpose of this part, computed in 
        accordance with this part. Such schedule of reductions shall be 
        established by regulation and published in the Federal Register 
        in accordance with section 482 of this Act.
            ``(2) No exceeding cost of attendance.--No TEACH Grant for 
        a student under this part shall exceed the cost of attendance 
        (as defined in section 472) at the institution that such 
        student attends. If, with respect to any student, it is 
        determined that the amount of a TEACH Grant exceeds the cost of 
        attendance for that year, the amount of the TEACH Grant shall 
        be reduced until the TEACH Grant does not exceed the cost of 
        attendance at such institution.
    ``(d) Period of Eligibility for Grants.--
            ``(1) Undergraduate students.--The period during which an 
        undergraduate student may receive TEACH Grants shall be the 
        period required for the completion of the first undergraduate 
        baccalaureate course of study being pursued by the student at 
        the institution that the student attends, except that--
                    ``(A) any period during which the student is 
                enrolled in a noncredit or remedial course of study, 
                subject to paragraph (3), shall not be counted for the 
                purpose of this paragraph; and
                    ``(B) the total amount that a student may receive 
                under this part for undergraduate study shall not 
                exceed $28,000.
            ``(2) Graduate students.--The period during which a 
        graduate student pursuing a master's degree or doctoral degree 
        may receive TEACH Grants shall be the period required for the 
        completion of a course of study for the degree at the 
        institution the student attends, except that the total amount 
        that a student may receive under this part for graduate study 
        shall not exceed $14,000 for a student pursuing a master's 
        degree or $28,000 for a student pursuing a doctoral degree.
            ``(3) Remedial course; study abroad.--Nothing in this 
        section shall exclude from eligibility a course of study that 
        is noncredit or remedial in nature (including a course in 
        English language acquisition) if such course is determined by 
        the institution to be necessary to help the student be prepared 
        for the pursuit of a first undergraduate baccalaureate degree 
        or certificate or, in the case of courses in English language 
        instruction, to be necessary to enable the student to utilize 
        existing knowledge, training, or skills. Nothing in this 
        section shall exclude from eligibility a program of study 
        abroad that is approved for credit by the home institution at 
        which the student is enrolled.

        sign a contract for educational opportunity in grade 8 and 
        satisfy the requirements of the contract. A CEO grant shall 
        provide each such student with a need-based financial aid 
        guarantee, in an amount equal to the student's calculated unmet 
        need to attend a 2- or 4-year degree-granting public 
        institution of higher education in the State, to enable the 
        student to attend a 2- or 4-year degree-granting public or

follows:

``SEC. 3004. INTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATIONS ON EXCHANGE RATE AND ECONOMIC 
              POLICIES.

    ``(a) Multilateral Negotiations.--The President shall seek to 
confer and negotiate with other countries--
          ``(1) to achieve--
                  ``(A) better coordination of macroeconomic policies 
                of the major industrialized nations; and

        rate system to provide for long-term exchange rate stability 
        consistent with more appropriate and sustainable current 
        account balances.
  ``(b) Bilateral Negotiations.--
            ``(1) In general.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall 
        analyze on an annual basis the exchange rate policies of 
        foreign countries, in consultation with the International 
        Monetary Fund, and consider whether countries manipulate the 
        rate of exchange between their currency and the United States 
        dollar for purposes of preventing effective balance of payments 
        adjustments or gaining unfair competitive advantage in 
        international trade. If the Secretary considers that such 
        manipulation is occurring with respect to any country that (A) 
        has material global current account surpluses and (B) has 
        significant bilateral trade surpluses with the United States,

        such foreign country on an expedited basis, in the 
        International Monetary Fund or bilaterally, for the purpose of 
        ensuring that such country regularly and promptly adjusts the 
        rate of exchange between its currencies and the United States 
        dollar to permit effective balance of payments adjustments and 
        to eliminate the unfair advantage.

                    ``(A) In general.--On and after the date that is 
                180 days after the date negotiations described in

                unless a certification described in paragraph (3) has 
                been made to Congress with respect to such country, in 
                addition to any other duty, there shall be imposed an 
                additional rate of duty equal to an amount determined 
                by the Secretary on any article that is the growth,

                        account balances.

        paragraph means a certification by the President to Congress 
        that the country with respect to which negotiations described

        foreign exchange reserves to prevent the appreciation of the 
        rate of exchange between its currency and the United States 
        dollar for purposes of gaining an unfair competitive advantage 
        in international trade. The certification shall also include a

        initiate negotiations in any case where such negotiations would 
        have a serious detrimental impact on vital national economic 
        and security interests. In such a case, the Secretary shall 
        inform the chairman and the ranking minority member of the

        and of the Committee on Financial Services of the House of

   Subtitle C--Encouraging Multilateral Corporations to Adopt Labor 
                               Practices

SEC. 4301. SHORT TITLE.

    This subtitle may be cited as the ``Global Worker Fairness Act''.

SEC. 4302. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) 1,400,000,000 workers around the world earn less than 
        $2 per day;
            (2) most of those workers live in countries that lack basic 
        labor protections, such as the protections against compulsory 
        and prison labor, protections against child labor, the right to 
        collective bargaining, and the right to a safe work 
        environment;
            (3) many of those workers are willing to do jobs that 
        workers in the United States do now, but for much lower wages, 
        reduced benefits, and reduced workplace safety and protections;
            (4) companies are often able to cut costs by exploiting 
        workers in other nations and not providing the workers with 
        adequate wages, benefits, or a safe workplace environment;
            (5) that exploitation creates a race to the bottom that 
        undercuts United States workers and costs jobs in the United 
        States; and
            (6) therefore, the United States needs to reward companies 
        that treat their foreign workers with decency and fairness, 
        because those companies are working to level the global playing 
        field for United States workers and deserve recognition for 
        their efforts.

SEC. 4303. DEFINITIONS.

    In this subtitle:
            (1) Core labor standards.--The term ``core labor 
        standards'' means the 8 fundamental labor conventions that the 
        International Labour Organization has identified.
            (2) Labor market.--The term ``labor market'' means a system 
        consisting of employers as buyers and workers as sellers, the 
        purpose of which is to match job vacancies with job applicants 
        and to set wages.
            (3) Multinational company.--The term ``multinational 
        company'' means a corporation, enterprise, or partnership, 
        including its subsidiaries, local affiliates, contractors, and
