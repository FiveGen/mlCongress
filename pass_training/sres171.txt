                               RESOLUTION


 
Designating March 25, 1998, as ``Greek Independence Day: A National Day 
           of Celebration of Greek and American Democracy''.

Whereas the ancient Greeks developed the concept of democracy, in which the 
        supreme power to govern was invested in the people;
Whereas the Founding Fathers of the United States of America drew heavily upon 
        the political experience and philosophy of ancient Greece in forming our 
        representative democracy;
Whereas the founders of the modern Greek state modeled their government after 
        that of the United States in an effort to best imitate their ancient 
        democracy;
Whereas Greece is one of the only 3 nations in the world, beyond the former 
        British Empire, that has been allied with the United States in every 
        major international conflict this century;
Whereas the heroism displayed in the historic World War II Battle of Crete 
        epitomized Greece's sacrifice for freedom and democracy as it presented 
        the Axis land war with its first major setback and set off a chain of 
        events which significantly affected the outcome of World War II;
Whereas these and other ideals have forged a close bond between our 2 nations 
        and their peoples;
Whereas March 25, 1998, marks the 177th anniversary of the beginning of the 
        revolution which freed the Greek people from the Ottoman Empire; and
Whereas it is proper and desirable to celebrate with the Greek people and to 
        reaffirm the democratic principles from which our 2 great nations were 
        born: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates March 25, 1998, as ``Greek Independence Day: 
        A National Day of Celebration of Greek and American 
        Democracy''; and
            (2) requests the President to issue a proclamation calling 
        upon the people of the United States to observe the day with 
        appropriate ceremonies and activities.
                                 <all>
