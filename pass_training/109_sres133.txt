  Recognizing the 13th Annual National Association of Letter Carriers 
                              Food Drive.

Whereas in 2003, 3,900,000 men, women, and children went hungry every day, a 
        troubling statistic that has steadily increased in recent years;
Whereas 23,000,000 men and women and more than 9,000,000 children rely on food 
        banks to survive every year;
Whereas in 1992, the National Association of Letter Carriers recognized this 
        crisis and began the ``Stamping Out Hunger'' national food drive;
Whereas 1,400 National Association of Letter Carriers branches in more than 
        10,000 cities in all 50 States have collected millions of pounds of food 
        every year since 1992;
Whereas in 2004, the National Association of Letter Carriers collected a record-
        breaking 70,900,000 pounds of food;
Whereas the National Association of Letter Carriers provides desperately needed 
        resources to food banks in the spring and summer months, the time when 
        donations levels are at their lowest;
Whereas the National Association of Letter Carriers has created much needed 
        bridges between its hard working members, residents in their 
        communities, and those in need;
Whereas the National Association of Letter Carriers Food Drive will take place 
        on May 14, 2005;
Whereas the National Association of Letter Carriers will send nearly 150,000,000 
        postcards to postal customers to urge donations for the Food Drive; and
Whereas letter carriers will be collecting food, as well as mail, at mailboxes 
        across the country, performing their daily job, and collecting food for 
        the hungry, come rain or shine: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) congratulates the members of the National Association 
        of Letter Carriers for their hard work on behalf of the 
        millions of people who go hungry each day; and
            (2) encourages the people of the United States to follow 
        the example of the members of the National Association of 
        Letter Carriers by donating food to local food banks and 
        participating in the National Association of Letter Carriers 
        Food Drive on May 14, 2005, by placing nonperishable food by 
        their mailboxes.
                                 <all>
