                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
Resolution raising awareness and encouraging prevention of stalking by 
  establishing January 2006 as ``National Stalking Awareness Month''.

Whereas an estimated 1,006,970 women and 370,990 men are stalked annually in the 
        United States and, in the majority of such cases, the person is stalked 
        by someone who is not a stranger;
Whereas 81 percent of women who are stalked by an intimate partner are also 
        physically assaulted by that partner, and 76 percent of women who are 
        killed by an intimate partner were also stalked by that intimate 
        partner;
Whereas 26 percent of stalking victims lose time from work as a result of their 
        victimization and 7 percent never return to work;
Whereas stalking victims are forced to take drastic measures to protect 
        themselves, such as relocating, changing their addresses, changing their 
        identities, changing jobs, and obtaining protection orders;
Whereas stalking is a crime that cuts across race, culture, gender, age, sexual 
        orientation, physical and mental ability, and economic status;
Whereas stalking is a crime under Federal law and under the laws of all 50 
        States and the District of Columbia;
Whereas rapid advancements in technology have made cyber-surveillance the new 
        frontier in stalking;
Whereas there are national organizations, local victim service organizations, 
        prosecutors' offices, and police departments that stand ready to assist 
        stalking victims and who are working diligently to craft competent, 
        thorough, and innovative responses to stalking;
Whereas there is a need to enhance the criminal justice system's response to 
        stalking and stalking victims, including aggressive investigation and 
        prosecution; and
Whereas Congress urges the establishment of January, 2006 as National Stalking 
        Awareness Month: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring), 
That--
            (1) it is the sense of Congress that--
                    (A) National Stalking Awareness Month provides an 
                opportunity to educate the people of the United States 
                about stalking;
                    (B) all Americans should applaud the efforts of the 
                many victim service providers, police, prosecutors, 
                national and community organizations, and private 
                sector supporters for their efforts in promoting 
                awareness about stalking; and
                    (C) policymakers, criminal justice officials, 
                victim service and human service agencies, nonprofits, 
                and others should recognize the need to increase 
                awareness of stalking and availability of services for 
                stalking victims; and
            (2) Congress urges national and community organizations, 
        businesses in the private sector, and the media to promote, 
        through National Stalking Awareness Month, awareness of the 
        crime of stalking.

            Passed the Senate November 10, 2005.

            Attest:

                                             EMILY J. REYNOLDS,

                                                             Secretary.
