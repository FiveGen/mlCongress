                 In the House of Representatives, U.S.,

                                                          June 9, 1998.
    Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in order to take 
from the Speaker's table the bill (H.R. 2709) to impose certain sanctions on 
foreign persons who transfer items contributing to Iran's efforts to acquire, 
develop, or produce ballistic missiles, with the Senate amendments thereto, and 
to consider in the House a single motion offered by the chairman of the 
Committee on International Relations or his designee that the House concur in 
each of the Senate amendments. The Senate amendments and the motion shall be 
considered as read. The motion shall be debatable for one hour equally divided 
and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on 
International Relations. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on 
the motion to final adoption without intervening motion or demand for division 
of the question.
            Attest:

                                                                          Clerk.
