                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing the sense of the Senate regarding the human rights situation 
                   in the People's Republic of China.

Whereas the annual meeting of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in 
        Geneva, Switzerland, provides a forum for discussing human rights and 
        expressing international support for improved human rights performance;
Whereas according to the United States Department of State and international 
        human rights organizations, the Government of the People's Republic of 
        China engages in widespread human rights violations; and
Whereas President Clinton pledged that the United States would step up its 
        efforts in cooperation with other states to insist that the United 
        Nations Commission on Human Rights pass a resolution dealing with the 
        serious human rights abuses in the People's Republic of China: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the United States 
should introduce and make all efforts necessary to pass a resolution 
criticizing the People's Republic of China for its human rights abuses 
in China and Tibet at the annual meeting of the United Nations 
Commission on Human Rights.
