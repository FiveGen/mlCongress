H. Res. 529

                 In the House of Representatives, U.S.,

                                                     December 14, 2005.
Whereas the United States recognized the Republic of Croatia on April 7, 1992, 
        acknowledging the decision of the people of Croatia to live in an 
        independent, democratic, and sovereign country;
Whereas since achieving their independence, the people of Croatia have built a 
        democratic society, based on the rule of law, respect for human rights, 
        and a free market economy;
Whereas Croatia is a functioning democracy, with stable institutions 
        guaranteeing the rule of law, human rights, and market economy;
Whereas Croatia has previously cooperated with the North Atlantic Treaty 
        Organization (NATO) by allowing NATO free access to its air space during 
        NATO's 1999 military action against Serbia;
Whereas the United States has shown support for Croatia in many ways since its 
        independence, including by providing Croatia with economic and military 
        assistance that has contributed significantly to the continued success;
Whereas Croatia is a reliable partner of the United States, actively 
        contributing to the stabilization of South Central Europe;
Whereas NATO's Membership Action Plan, which was launched in April 1999, is a 
        program of assistance that provides both goals and a roadmap for 
        countries aspiring to NATO membership;
Whereas Croatia was invited into the Membership Action Plan in May 2002 and has 
        made substantial progress in attaining the necessary level of reforms 
        required for receiving an invitation to start accession talks with NATO;
Whereas the United States, Croatia, Albania, and Macedonia are signatories to 
        the United States-Adriatic Charter, which promotes Euro-Atlantic 
        integration and commits the signatory nations to the values and 
        principles of NATO and to joining the Alliance at the earliest possible 
        time;
Whereas Croatia significantly improved its cooperation with the International 
        Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY);
Whereas on October 3, 2005, the European Union decided to open accession 
        negotiations with Croatia based on the assessment of its Council of 
        Ministers that Croatia met the political and economic criteria for 
        candidacy in the European Union, including that Croatia was fully 
        cooperating with the ICTY;
Whereas Croatia has sent troops to Afghanistan as part of the NATO-led 
        International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in support of the war 
        against terrorism and has endorsed and is participating in the 
        Proliferation Security Initiative with like-minded nations across the 
        world to prevent the flow of weapons of mass destruction, missile 
        systems, and related material; and
Whereas Croatia shares the common interests and values of the free and 
        democratic world: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives that--
            (1) the Republic of Croatia has made significant progress since its 
        independence in strengthening its democratic institutions and respect 
        for human rights and the rule of law;
            (2) Croatia should be commended for its progress in meeting the 
        political, economic, military, and other requirements of NATO's 
        Membership Action Plan, its contribution to the global war on terrorism, 
        and for its constructive participation in the United States-Adriatic 
        Charter;
            (3) the Government of Croatia should be commended for its ongoing 
        cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former 
        Yugoslavia;
            (4) Croatia would make a significant contribution to NATO; and
            (5) with complete satisfaction of NATO guidelines and criteria for 
        membership, Croatia should be invited to be a full member of the North 
        Atlantic Treaty Organization at the earliest possible date.



            Attest:

                                                                 Clerk.
