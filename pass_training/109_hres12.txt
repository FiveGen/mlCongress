[H. Res. 12 Engrossed in House (EH)]


                 In the House of Representatives, U.S.,

                                                       January 4, 2005.
Whereas on December 26, 2004, a powerful earthquake measuring 9.0 on the Richter 
        Scale occurred off the west coast of Northern Sumatra, Indonesia;
Whereas the undersea earthquake created massive tsunamis that struck several 
        countries throughout South and Southeast Asia, as well as on the coast 
        of East Africa;
Whereas the giant waves caused death and destruction on a nearly unprecedented 
        scale, killing more than 140,000 people and leaving millions homeless;
Whereas many thousands of people were killed in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, and 
        Thailand, and numerous others were killed in Somalia, Malaysia, 
        Maldives, Bangladesh, Kenya, Burma, and elsewhere;
Whereas an estimated one-third of the earthquake and tsunami victims were 
        children, and many thousands more have been left orphaned or separated 
        from their families;
Whereas thousands of visitors and tourists from nearly 40 countries were killed 
        in this natural disaster;
Whereas between 3,000,000 and 5,000,000 people throughout the affected region 
        are lacking basic survival requirements as a result of the tsunamis and 
        there remains the risk of numerous additional deaths due to shortages of 
        clean water, adequate shelter, food, sanitation, and basic healthcare;
Whereas the United States and other donors have, to date, pledged an estimated 
        $2,000,000,000 in emergency and long-term reconstruction assistance; and
Whereas the human cost of this disaster transcends mere statistics and has 
        resulted in deeply personal tragedies for countless families in the 
        region and throughout the world: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved,  That the House of Representatives--
            (1) mourns the horrific loss of life caused by the earthquake and 
        tsunamis that occurred on December 26, 2004, in South and Southeast 
        Asia;
            (2) expresses its deep condolences to the families of the many 
        earthquake and tsunami victims;
            (3) applauds the prompt humanitarian response to the tsunami tragedy 
        by governments, the United Nations and other international 
        organizations, and nongovernmental organizations;
            (4) recognizes the generous outpouring of support for relief efforts 
        from private citizens around the world, including in the United States;
            (5) affirms its commitment to additional generous United States 
        support for relief and long-term reconstruction efforts in areas 
        affected by the earthquake and tsunamis; and
            (6) urges continued attention by donors and relief agencies to the 
        needs of vulnerable populations in the stricken countries, particularly 
        the thousands of children who have been left parentless and homeless by 
        this disaster.
            Attest:

                                                                          Clerk.
