another department or agency of the Federal Government using the 
property for a use similar to the use under the lease. Exercise of the 
authority provided by this clause shall be made in consultation with 
the redevelopment authority concerned.

    ``(III) For purposes of this clause, facility services and common 
area maintenance shall not include municipal services that the State or 
local government concerned is required by law to provide without direct
