                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                             July 12, 2006

Mr. Obama (for himself, Mr. DeMint, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Isakson, and Mr.

                               agreed to

                               RESOLUTION


 
    Designating July 13, 2006, as ``National Summer Learning Day''.

Whereas all students experience measurable loss of mathematics and reading 
        skills when they do not engage in educational activities during the 
        summer months;
Whereas summer learning loss is greatest for low-income children, who often lack 
        the academic enrichment opportunities available to their more affluent 
        peers;
Whereas summer learning loss contributes significantly to the gaps in 
        achievement between low-income children, including minority children and 
        children with limited English proficiency, and their more affluent 
        peers;
Whereas structured enrichment and education programs are proven to accelerate 
        learning for students who participate in such programs for several weeks 
        during the summer;
Whereas in the BELL summer programs, students gain several months worth of 
        reading and mathematics skills through summer enrichment, and in the 
        Teach Baltimore Summer Academy, students enrolled for 2 summers gain 70 
        to 80 percent of a full grade level in reading, and thousands of 
        students in similar programs experience measurable gains in academic 
        achievement;
Whereas Summer Learning Day is designed to highlight the need for more young 
        people to be engaged in summer learning activities and to support local 
        summer programs that benefit children, families, and communities; and
Whereas a wide array of schools, public agencies, non-profit organizations, 
        institutions of higher education, museums, libraries, and summer camps 
        in many States across the United States will celebrate the annual Summer 
        Learning Day on July 13, 2006: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates July 13, 2006, as ``National Summer Learning 
        Day'' to raise public awareness about the positive impact of 
        summer learning opportunities on the development and 
        educational success of our Nation's children;
            (2) urges the people of the United States--
                    (A) to promote summer learning activities to send 
                young people back to school ready to learn;
                    (B) to support working parents and their children; 
                and
                    (C) to keep our Nation's children safe and healthy 
                during the summer months; and
            (3) urges communities to celebrate, with appropriate 
        ceremonies and activities, the importance of high-quality 
        summer learning opportunities in the lives of young students 
        and their families.
                                 <all>
