Expressing the sense of Congress regarding the 30th anniversary of the 
         enactment of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act.

Whereas clean water is a natural resource of tremendous value and importance to 
        the United States;
Whereas there is resounding public support for protecting and enhancing the 
        quality of the rivers, streams, lakes, wetland, and marine water of the 
        United States;
Whereas maintaining and improving water quality is essential to protecting 
        public health, fisheries, wildlife, and watersheds, and to ensuring 
        abundant opportunities for public recreation and economic development;
Whereas it is a national responsibility to provide clean water for future 
        generations;
Whereas substantial progress has been made in protecting and enhancing water 
        quality since the date of enactment, in 1972, of the Federal Water 
        Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) due to concerted efforts 
        by Federal, State, and local governments, the private sector, and the 
        public;
Whereas serious water pollution problems persist throughout the United States 
        and significant challenges lie ahead in the effort to protect water 
        resources from point sources and nonpoint sources of pollution;
Whereas further development and innovation of water pollution control programs 
        and advancement of water pollution control research, technology, and 
        education are necessary and desirable; and
Whereas October 2002 is the 30th anniversary of the enactment of the Federal 
        Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.): Now, therefore be 
        it
    Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring), 
That, as the United States marks the 30th anniversary, in October 2002, 
of the enactment of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 
1251 et seq.), Congress encourages the people of the United States and 
all levels of government to recognize and celebrate the accomplishments 
of the United States under, and to recommit to achieving the goals of, 
that Act.

            Passed the Senate December 18, 2001.

            Attest:

                                                  JERI THOMSON,

                                                             Secretary.
