[H. Res. 93 Engrossed in House (EH)]


                 In the House of Representatives, U.S.,

                                                           May 7, 1997.
Whereas the Consumer Price Index currently informs our Nation's monetary policy, 
        and determines both the level of taxes paid and the amount of government 
        benefits received by millions of Americans, many of them on fixed 
        incomes;
Whereas the Consumer Price Index is assumed in these uses to be an accurate and 
        appropriate measurement;
Whereas the Consumer Price Index is only useful if it is a technical, not a 
        political measurement;
Whereas it is of the utmost importance to maintain the integrity and objectivity 
        of the determination process and of the reliability of the Federal 
        statistical system;
Whereas it is the Bureau of Labor Statistics that has the expertise, tools, 
        resources, and experience to maintain this integrity and objectivity; 
        and
Whereas it is vital to protect our senior citizens and others on fixed incomes 
        that we use the most appropriate and accurate criteria: Now, therefore, 
        be it
    Resolved,  That any adjustments to the methodology used to determine the 
Consumer Price Index should be made by the Bureau of Labor Statistics alone.
            Attest:

                                                                          Clerk.
