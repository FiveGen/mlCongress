        aggravated assaults, and 3,590 arsons were reported on-campus from 2000 
        to 2002;
Whereas between one fifth and one quarter of female students become the victim

        opportunity for colleges and universities to inform students about 
        existing campus crime trends, campus security policies, crime prevention 
        techniques, fire safety, and alcohol and other drug education,
