                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
  Recognizing and honoring the National Guard on the occasion of the 
 365th anniversary of its historic beginning with the founding of the 
                militia of the Massachusetts Bay Colony.

Whereas the National Guard is the oldest component of the Armed Forces of the 
        United States, founded on December 13, 1636, as the militia of the 
        Massachusetts Bay Colony;
Whereas the citizen soldiers and airmen of the National Guard have fought in 
        every major American conflict, from the colonial wars of the 17th 
        century to the ongoing operations against the al Qaeda terrorist network 
        and the Taliban regime in Afghanistan that harbored those terrorists;
Whereas the National Guard traditionally has served with distinction as 
        America's first line of defense against the consequences of natural and 
        man-made disasters within the United States;
Whereas the men and women of the National Guard serve as an indispensable part 
        of critical United States military operations around the world, 
        including patrolling the no-fly zones over Iraq and peacekeeping in the 
        Balkans;
Whereas headquarters elements of National Guard combat divisions lead the United 
        States' participation in the multinational Stabilization Force in 
        Bosnia;
Whereas the men and women of the National Guard were among the first to respond 
        to the terrorist atrocities of September 11, 2001, including Air 
        National Guard fighter crews who scrambled on that day and Army National 
        Guard personnel who deployed to assist with rescue and recovery efforts 
        in New York and Virginia;
Whereas the men and women of the National Guard, in keeping with the National 
        Guard's historic mission of homeland defense, are flying combat air 
        patrols to protect the safety of American airspace and are performing 
        critical security roles in their State capacity at airports and other 
        important sites around the Nation; and
Whereas the citizen soldiers and airmen of the National Guard serve a critical 
        role in protecting the freedom of American citizens and the American 
        ideals of justice, liberty, and freedom, both at home and abroad: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring), 
That, on December 13, 2001, the occasion of the 365th anniversary of 
the founding of the militia of the Massachusetts Bay Colony that was 
the precursor to the force of citizen soldiers and airmen now proudly 
known as the National Guard, Congress--
            (1) recognizes that anniversary of the National Guard as an 
        important milestone in the military tradition of the United 
        States;
            (2) honors the commitment and sacrifices made by the 
        458,400 citizen soldiers and airmen of the National Guard, 
        their families, their employers, and their communities;
            (3) recognizes the critical importance of the National 
        Guard, at home and abroad, to the national security of the 
        United States;
            (4) salutes the citizen soldiers and airmen of the National 
        Guard for their service on September 11, 2001, and their 
        continuing role in homeland defense and military operations 
        against the al Qaeda terrorist network and the Taliban regime 
        in Afghanistan that harbored those terrorists;
            (5) supports a policy of providing the National Guard with 
        resources necessary to ensure its continued readiness; and
            (6) expresses the deep gratitude of the American people to 
        the men and women of the National Guard for their dedication 
        and commitment to the security and freedom of the United 
        States.
