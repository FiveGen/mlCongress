                               RESOLUTION


 
     Designating October 16, 1998, as ``National Mammography Day''.

Whereas according to the American Cancer Society, in 1998, 178,700 women will be 
        diagnosed with breast cancer and 43,500 women will die from this 
        disease;
Whereas in the decade of the 1990's, it is estimated that about 2,000,000 women 
        will be diagnosed with breast cancer, resulting in nearly 500,000 
        deaths;
Whereas the risk of breast cancer increases with age, with a woman at age 70 
        having twice as much of a chance of developing the disease as a woman at 
        age 50;
Whereas at least 80 percent of the women who get breast cancer have no family 
        history of the disease;
Whereas mammograms, when operated professionally at a certified facility, can 
        provide a safe and quick diagnosis;
Whereas experts agree that mammography is the best method of early detection of 
        breast cancer, and early detection is the key to saving lives;
Whereas mammograms can reveal the presence of small cancers up to 2 years or 
        more before a regular clinical breast examination or breast self-
        examination (BSE), reducing mortality by more than 30 percent; and
Whereas 47 States and the District of Columbia have passed legislation requiring 
        health insurance companies to cover mammograms in accordance with 
        recognized screening guidelines: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates October 16, 1998, as ``National Mammography 
        Day''; and
            (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation 
        calling upon the people of the United States to observe such 
        day with appropriate programs and activities.
                                 <all>
