                               RESOLUTION


 
Recognizing the creation of the NASCAR-Historically Black Colleges and 
                        Universities Consortium.

Whereas the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that, while there are 1,300,000 
        automotive technicians currently employed, industry figures confirm that 
        an additional 50,000 technicians are needed to fill open positions each 
        year;
Whereas the National Automotive Dealers Association reports that 57 percent of 
        the operating profit of automotive dealers is generated by the parts and 
        service departments of automotive dealers;
Whereas the findings of the National Automotive Dealers Association reveal that 
        dealers consider it difficult to locate qualified technicians;
Whereas 42 percent of all dealer technicians have been engaged in that line of 
        work for less than 1 year;
Whereas the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing, Inc. (referred to in 
        this preamble as ``NASCAR''), the NASCAR Universal Technical Institute, 
        and a collaboration of Historically Black Colleges and Universities 
        (referred to in this preamble as ``HBCUs'') have agreed to create a 
        consortium to increase the number of quality job opportunities available 
        to African American students in key racing and other related automotive 
        business activities, including automotive engineering and technology, 
        automotive safety, sports marketing, and other automotive industry 
        areas;
Whereas the NASCAR-HBCUs Consortium is establishing a formal plan to increase 
        the number of quality job opportunities available to African American 
        students within NASCAR in key racing and other related automotive 
        business activities through the NASCAR Universal Training Institute and 
        the NASCAR Diversity Internship Program;
Whereas NASCAR has agreed to enhance their identification of employment 
        opportunities, including internships, full time jobs, entry level 
        management positions, part-time jobs for college students, and post-
        graduate job placement for students pursuing undergraduate and graduate 
        degrees at partner HBCUs;
Whereas the NASCAR-HBCUs Consortium has developed a program to increase the 
        awareness, access, and participation of African American students in the 
        NASCAR Universal Training Institute and NASCAR Diversity Internship 
        Program for the racing and other related automotive industries; and
Whereas the NASCAR-HBCUs Consortium will seek opportunities to establish and 
        enhance the funding of targeted job development activities by partner 
        HBCUs, and generate support for the HBCUs in their efforts to enhance 
        curriculum development in sports marketing, finance, human resource 
        management, and other automotive industry areas: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes the National Association for Stock Car Auto 
        Racing, Inc. (referred to in this resolution as ``NASCAR''), 
        the NASCAR Universal Technical Institute, and a collaboration 
        of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (referred to in 
        this resolution as ``HBCUs''), for their creation of a 
        consortium to increase the number of quality job opportunities 
        available to African American students in key racing and other 
        related automotive business activities;
            (2) commends HBCUs, including Alabama A&M University, 
        Alabama State University, Bethune Cookman College, Howard 
        University, North Carolina A&T University, Talladega College, 
        and Winston-Salem State University, for their efforts to 
        increase the number of quality job opportunities available to 
        African American students in key racing and other related 
        automotive business activities; and
            (3) encourages the Departments of Education and Labor and 
        other appropriate agencies of the Federal Government to provide 
        suitable assistance and support to ensure the success of that 
        effort.
                                 <all>
