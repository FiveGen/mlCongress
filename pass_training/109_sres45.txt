                               RESOLUTION


 
Commending the James Madison University Dukes football team for winning 
      the 2004 NCAA Division I-AA National Football Championship.

Whereas the students, alumni, faculty, and supporters of James Madison 
        University are to be congratulated for their commitment and pride in the 
        James Madison University Dukes national champion football team;
Whereas in the National Collegiate Athletic Association championship game 
        against the Montana Grizzlies, the Dukes drove to a 10-to-7 lead at the 
        half on the strength of the 1-yard touchdown by seemingly indefatigable 
        tailback Maurice Fenner and the 28-yard field goal by kicker David 
        Rabil;
Whereas the Dukes won the 2004 NCAA Division I-AA National Football Championship 
        with an outstanding second half performance, rushing for 257 yards and 
        outscoring the Montana Grizzlies 21 to 14, to win the Championship by a 
        score of 31 to 21;
Whereas the Dukes added the NCAA Division I-AA title to their share in the 
        Atlantic Ten Conference title to claim their second championship in 
        2004;
Whereas every player on the Dukes football team (Nick Adams, Ryan Bache, L.C. 
        Baker, Alvin Banks, Brandon Beach, Antoinne Bolton, D.D. Boxley, Rondell 
        Bradley, Isai Bradshaw, Ardon Bransford, Anderson Braswell, Marvin 
        Brown, Michael Brown, Ryan Brown, Shawn Bryant, George Burns, Robbie 
        Catterton, Frank Cobbs, Sean Connaghan, Jamaal Crowder, Ben Crumlin, 
        Corey Davis, John Michael Deeds, Isaiah Dottin-Carter, Harry Dunn, Sudan 
        Ellington, Nick Englehart, Sid Evans, Maurice Fenner, Adam Ford, Casime 
        Harris, Josh Haymore, Marcus Haywood, Tahir Hinds, Raymond Hines, Ryan 
        Holston, Ryan Horn, David Ingraldi, Chris Iorio, Mike Jenkins, Bruce 
        Johnson, Shelton Johnson, Akeem Jordan, Jacob Kahle, Clint Kent, Andrew 
        Kern, Tim Kibler, Joe Kluesner, Rodney Landers, Scott Lemn, Matt 
        LeZotte, Matt Magerko, Dexter Manley, Franklin Martin, Justin Mathias, 
        Frank McArdle, Rodney McCarter, Craig McSherry, Andrew Michael, Bryce 
        Miller, Leon Mizelle, Mike Mozby, William Nowell, Tom O'Connor, Will 
        Patrick, David Rabil, Justin Rascati, Tom Ridley, Demetrius Shambley, 
        Khary Sharpe, Andre Shuler, Bryan Smith, Leon Steinfeld, Chuck Suppon, 
        Cortez Thompson, Nic Tolley, Trey Townsend, Brian Vaccarino, Kwynn 
        Walton, Paul Wantuck, Mike Wilkerson, Kevin Winston, Stephen Wyatt, Kyle 
        Zehr, and Jake Zielinski) contributed to the success of the team in this 
        impressive championship season;
Whereas the Dukes became the first team in Division I-AA history to win the 
        national title without playing a single playoff game at home, battling 
        for 3 consecutive playoff road victories;
Whereas the Dukes football team Head Coach Mickey Matthews has won 40 games in 
        his 6 years at James Madison University and has taken the Dukes to the 
        playoffs twice in his tenure;
Whereas Coach Matthews has been named the 2004 Division I-AA National Coach of 
        the Year by the American Football Coaches Association, for his 
        performance in the Dukes championship season; and
Whereas Assistant Coaches Curt Newsome, Jeff Durden, George Barlow, Kyle 
        Gillenwater, Phil Ratliff, Chip West, Ulrick Edmonds, J.C. Price, Tony 
        Tallent, and Jim Durning deserve high recommendation for their strong 
        leadership of, and superb coaching support to, the James Madison 
        University Dukes football team: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) congratulates James Madison University Dukes football 
        team for winning the 2004 NCAA Division I-AA National 
        Championship; and
            (2) recognizes the achievements of all the players, 
        coaches, and support staff of the team.
                                 <all>
