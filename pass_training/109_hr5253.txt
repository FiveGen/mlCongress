SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Energy Price Protection Act 
of 2006''.

SEC. 2. GASOLINE PRICE GOUGING PROHIBITED.

    (a) Unlawful Conduct.--
            (1) Unfair and deceptive act or practice.--It shall be an 
        unfair or deceptive act or practice in violation of section 5 
        of the Federal Trade Commission Act for any person to sell 
        crude oil, gasoline, diesel fuel, home heating oil, or any 
        biofuel at a price that constitutes price gouging as defined by 
        rule pursuant to subsection (b).
            (2) Definition.--For purposes of this subsection, the term 
        ``biofuel'' means any fuel containing any organic matter that 
        is available on a renewable or recurring basis, including 
        agricultural crops and trees, wood and wood wastes and 
        residues, plants (including aquatic plants), grasses, residues, 
        fibers, and animal wastes, municipal wastes, and other waste 
        materials.
    (b) Price Gouging.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 6 months after the date of 
        the enactment of this Act, the Federal Trade Commission shall 
        promulgate, in accordance with section 553 of title 5, United 
        States Code, any rules necessary for the enforcement of this 
        section.
            (2) Contents.--Such rules--
                    (A) shall define ``price gouging'', ``retail 
                sale'', and ``wholesale sale'' for purposes of this 
                Act; and
                    (B) shall be consistent with the requirements for 
                declaring unfair acts or practices in section 5(n) of 
                the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 45(n)).
    (c) Enforcement.--
            (1) In general.--Except as provided in subsection (d), a 
        violation of subsection (a) shall be treated as a violation of 
        a rule defining an unfair or deceptive act or practice 
        prescribed under section 18(a)(1)(B) of the Federal Trade 
        Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 57a(a)(1)(B)). The Federal Trade 
        Commission shall enforce this Act in the same manner, by the 
        same means, and with the same jurisdiction as though all 
        applicable terms and provisions of the Federal Trade Commission 
        Act were incorporated into and made a part of this Act.
            (2) Exclusive enforcement.--Notwithstanding any other 
        provision of law, no person, State, or political subdivision of 
        a State, other than the Federal Trade Commission or the 
        Attorney General of the United States to the extent provided 
        for in section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act or the 
        attorney general of a State as provided by subsection (d), 
        shall have any authority to enforce this Act or any rule 
        prescribed pursuant to this Act.
    (d) Enforcement by State Attorneys General.--
            (1) Civil action.--In any case in which the attorney 
        general of a State has reason to believe that an interest of 
        the residents of that State has been or is threatened or 
        adversely affected by any person who violates subsection (a), 
        the attorney general, as parens patriae, may bring a civil 
        action on behalf of the residents of the State in a district 
        court of the United States of appropriate jurisdiction--
                    (A) to enjoin further violation of such section by 
                the defendant;
                    (B) to compel compliance with such section; or
                    (C) to impose a civil penalty under subsection (e).
            (2) Intervention by the ftc.--
                    (A) Notice and intervention.--The State shall 
                provide prior written notice of any action under 
                paragraph (1) to the Federal Trade Commission and 
                provide the Commission with a copy of its complaint, 
                except in any case in which such prior notice is not 
                feasible, in which case the State shall serve such 
                notice immediately upon instituting such action. The 
                Commission shall have the right--
                            (i) to intervene in the action;
                            (ii) upon so intervening, to be heard on 
                        all matters arising therein; and
                            (iii) to file petitions for appeal.
                    (B) Limitation on state action while federal action 
                is pending.--If the Commission has instituted a civil 
                action for violation of this Act, no attorney general 
                of a State may bring an action under this subsection 
                during the pendency of that action against any 
                defendant named in the complaint of the Commission for 
                any violation of this Act alleged in the complaint.
            (3) Construction with respect to powers conferred by state 
        law.--For purposes of bringing any civil action under paragraph 
        (1), nothing in this Act shall be construed to prevent an 
        attorney general of a State from exercising the powers 
        conferred on the attorney general by the laws of that State.
    (e) Civil Penalty.--
            (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any civil penalty that 
        otherwise applies to a violation of a rule referred to in

        be liable for a civil penalty under this subsection.

                        such a sale.
