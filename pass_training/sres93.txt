                               RESOLUTION

Designating the week beginning November 23, 1997, and the week beginning on 
        November 22, 1998, as ``National Family Week'', and for other purposes.
Whereas the family is the basic strength of any free and orderly society;
Whereas it is appropriate to honor the family unit as essential to the continued 
        well-being of the United States; and
Whereas it is fitting that official recognition be given to the importance of 
        family loyalties and ties: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate designates the week beginning on November 
23, 1997 and the week beginning on November 22, 1998, as ``National 
Family Week''. The Senate requests the President to issue a 
proclamation calling on the people of the United States to observe each 
week with appropriate ceremonies and activities
