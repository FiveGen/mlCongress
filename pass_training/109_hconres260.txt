                                     Agreed to November 10, 2005        

                       One Hundred Ninth Congress

                                 of the

                        United States of America


                          AT THE FIRST SESSION

          Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday,
            the fourth day of January, two thousand and five


                          Concurrent Resolution

Whereas 2005 marks the 40th anniversary of the promulgation of Nostra 
  Aetate, the declaration on the relation of the Roman Catholic Church 
  to non-Christian religions;

Whereas on October 28, 1965, after the overwhelmingly affirmative vote 
  of the Second Vatican Council of the Roman Catholic Church, Pope Paul 
  VI issued Nostra Aetate, which means ``in our time'';

Whereas Nostra Aetate affirmed the respect of the Roman Catholic Church 
  for Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, and Judaism, and exhorted Catholics to 
  engage in ``dialogue and collaboration with the followers of other 
  religions'';

Whereas Nostra Aetate made possible a new relationship between 
  Catholics and Jews worldwide and opened a chapter in Jewish-Christian 
  relations that is unprecedented in its closeness and warmth;

Whereas Nostra Aetate states that the Roman Catholic Church ``decries 
  hatred, persecution, displays of anti-Semitism, directed against Jews 
  at any time and by anyone''; and

Whereas Nostra Aetate clearly states that ``No foundation therefore 
  remains for any theory or practice that leads to discrimination 
  between man and man or people and people, so far as their human 
  dignity and the rights flowing from it are concerned.'': Now, 
  therefore, be it

    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That Congress--
        (1) recognizes the 40th anniversary of the Second Vatican 
    Council's promulgation of Nostra Aetate, the declaration on the 
    relation of the Roman Catholic Church to non-Christian religions;
        (2) appreciates the role of the Holy See in combating religious 
    intolerance and religious discrimination;
        (3) encourages the United States to continue to serve in a 
    leading role in combating anti-Semitism and other forms of 
    religious intolerance and religious discrimination worldwide;
        (4) acknowledges the role of Nostra Aetate in fostering 
    interreligious dialogue and mutual respect, including, in 
    particular, new relationships of collaboration and dialogue between 
    Jews and Catholics since the issuance of Nostra Aetate; and
        (5) requests the President to issue a proclamation recognizing 
    the 40th anniversary of Nostra Aetate and the historic role of 
    Nostra Aetate in fostering mutual interreligious respect and 
    dialogue.
  Attest:
