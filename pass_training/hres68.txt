                 In the House of Representatives, U.S.,

                                                        March 11, 1997.
Whereas the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security Between the United States 
        of America and Japan is critical to the security interests of the United 
        States, Japan, and the countries of the Asia-Pacific region;
Whereas the security relationship between the United States and Japan is the 
        foundation for the security strategy of the United States in the Asia-
        Pacific region;
Whereas strong bilateral security ties between the two countries provide a key 
        stabilizing influence in an uncertain post-cold war world;
Whereas this bilateral security relationship makes it possible for the United 
        States and Japan to preserve their interests in the Asia-Pacific region;
Whereas forward-deployed forces of the United States are welcomed by allies of 
        the United States in the region because such forces are critical for 
        maintaining stability in East Asia;
Whereas regional stability has undergirded East Asia's economic growth and 
        prosperity;
Whereas the recognition by allies of the United States of the importance of 
        United States armed forces for security in the Asia-Pacific region 
        confers on the United States irreplaceable good will and diplomatic 
        influence in that region;
Whereas Japan's host nation support is a key element in the ability of the 
        United States to maintain forward-deployed forces in that country;
Whereas the Governments of the United States and Japan, in the Special Action 
        Committee on Okinawa Final Report issued by the United States-Japan 
        Security Consultative Committee established by the two countries, made 
        commitments to reducing the burdens of United States armed forces on the 
        people of Japan, especially the people of Okinawa;
Whereas such commitments must maintain the operational capability and readiness 
        of United States forces; and
Whereas gaining the understanding and support of the people of Japan, especially 
        the people of Okinawa, in fulfilling these commitments is crucial to the 
        effective implementation of the Treaty: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives 
that--
            (1) the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security Between 
        the United States of America and Japan remains vital to the 
        security interests of the United States and Japan, as well as 
        the countries of the Asia-Pacific region; and
            (2) the people of Japan, especially the people of Okinawa, 
        deserve special recognition and gratitude for their 
        contributions toward ensuring the Treaty's implementation and 
        regional peace and stability.

            Attest:

                                                                 Clerk.
