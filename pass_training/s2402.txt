    (c) Terms and Conditions.--
            (1) Notwithstanding exceptions of application under the

        consideration for the conveyance described in subsection (a) 
        shall be--
                    (A) an amount that is consistent with the Bureau of 
                Land Management special pricing program for 
                Governmental entities under the Recreation and Public

                from the property.
            (2) The lands conveyed by this Act shall be used for 
        educational and recreational purposes. If such lands cease to 
        be used for such purposes, at the option of the United States, 
        such lands will revert to the United States.
