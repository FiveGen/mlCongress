                               RESOLUTION


 
  Designating June 5, 2002, as ``National Hunger Awareness Day'' and 
authorizing that the Senate office of Senator Richard J. Durbin be used 
 to collect donations of food from June 5, 2002, until June 14, 2002, 
    from concerned Members of Congress and staff to assist families 
   suffering from hunger and food insecurity in the Washington, D.C. 
                           metropolitan area.

Whereas food insecurity and hunger are a fact of life for millions of low-income 
        Americans and can produce physical, mental, and social impairments;
Whereas recent census data show that almost 13,000,000 children in the United 
        States live in families experiencing hunger or food insecurity;
Whereas the problem of hunger and food insecurity can be found in rural, 
        suburban, and urban America, touching nearly every American community;
Whereas although substantial progress has been made in reducing the incidence of 
        hunger and food insecurity in the United States, certain groups, 
        including the working poor, the elderly, homeless people, children, 
        migrant workers, and Native Americans remain vulnerable to hunger and 
        the negative effects of food deprivation;
Whereas the people of the United States have a long tradition of providing food 
        assistance to hungry people through acts of private generosity and 
        public support programs;
Whereas the United States Government, through Federal food assistance programs 
        like the Federal Food Stamp Program, child nutrition programs, and food 
        donation programs, provides essential nutrition support to millions of 
        low-income people;
Whereas there is a growing awareness of the important public and private 
        partnership role that community-based organizations, institutions of 
        faith, and charities provide in assisting hungry and food insecure 
        people;
Whereas more than 50,000 local community-based organizations rely on the support 
        and efforts of more than 1,000,000 volunteers to provide food assistance 
        and services to millions of vulnerable people;
Whereas a diverse group of organizations, including America's Second Harvest, 
        the United States Conference of Mayors, and other organizations have 
        documented substantial increases in requests for emergency food 
        assistance over the past year; and
Whereas all Americans can help participate in hunger relief efforts in their 
        communities by donating food and money, by volunteering, and by 
        supporting public policies aimed at reducing hunger: Now, therefore, be 
        it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates June 5, 2002, as ``National Hunger Awareness 
        Day'';
            (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation 
        calling upon the people of the United States to observe 
        ``National Hunger Awareness Day''--
                    (A) with appropriate ceremonies, volunteer 
                activities, and other support for local antihunger 
                advocacy efforts and hunger relief charities, including 
                food banks, food rescue organizations, food pantries, 
                soup kitchens, and emergency shelters; and
                    (B) with the year-round support of programs and 
                public policies that reduce hunger and food insecurity 
                in the United States; and
            (3) office of Senator Richard J. Durbin is authorized to 
        collect donations of food from June 5, 2002, until June 14, 
        2002, from concerned Members of Congress and staff to assist 
        families suffering from hunger and food insecurity in the 
        Washington, D.C. metropolitan area.
