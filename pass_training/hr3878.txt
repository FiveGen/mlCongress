SECTION 1. LEASING OF CERTAIN RESERVED MINERAL INTERESTS.

    (a) Application of Mineral Leasing Act.--Notwithstanding the 
provisions of section 4 of the 1964 Public Land Sale Act (P.L. 88-608, 
78 Stat. 988), the Federal reserved mineral interests in lands conveyed 
under that Act by United States land patents No. 49-71-0059 and No. 49-
71-0065 shall be subject to the operation of the Mineral Leasing Act 
(30 U.S.C. 181 et seq.).
    (b) Entry.--Any person who acquires any lease under the Mineral 
Leasing Act for the interests referred to in subsection (a) may 
exercise the right to enter reserved to the United States and persons 
authorized by the United States in the patents conveying the lands 
described in subsection (a) by occupying so much of the surface thereof 
as may be required for all purposes reasonably incident to the 
exploration for, and extraction and removal of, the leased minerals by 
either of the following means:
            (1) By securing the written consent or waiver of the 
        patentee.
            (2) In the absence of such consent or waiver, by posting a 
        bond or other financial guarantee with the Secretary of the 
        Interior in an amount sufficient to insure--
                    (A) the completion of reclamation pursuant to the 
                Secretary's requirements under the Mineral Leasing Act; 
                and
                    (B) the payment to the surface owner for--
                            (i) any damages to crops and tangible 
                        improvements of the surface owner that result 
                        from activities under the mineral lease; and
                            (ii) any permanent loss of income to the 
                        surface owner due to loss or impairment of 
                        grazing use, or of other uses of the land by 
                        the surface owner at the time of commencement 
                        of activities under the mineral lease.
    (c) Lands Covered by Patent No. 49-71-0065.--In the case of the 
lands in United States patent No. 49-71-0065, the preceding provisions 
of this section take effect January 1, 1997.

            Passed the House of Representatives October 14, 1998.

            Attest:

                                                                 Clerk.
