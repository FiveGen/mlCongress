                               RESOLUTION


 
To authorize the production of records by the Permanent Subcommittee on 
 Investigations of the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental 
                                Affairs.

Whereas the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Committee on 
        Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs has been conducting an 
        investigation into the United Nations ``Oil-for-Food'' Programme;
Whereas the Subcommittee has received a number of requests from law enforcement 
        officials, regulatory agencies, and other governmental entities for 
        access to records of the Subcommittee's investigation;
Whereas, by the privileges of the Senate of the United States and rule XI of the 
        Standing Rules of the Senate, no evidence under the control or in the 
        possession of the Senate can, by administrative or judicial process, be 
        taken from such control or possession but by permission of the Senate; 
        and
Whereas, when it appears that evidence under the control or in the possession of 
        the Senate is needed for the promotion of justice, the Senate will take 
        such action as will promote the ends of justice consistent with the 
        pivileges of the Senate: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of the 
Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Committee on Homeland 
Security and Governmental Affairs, acting jointly, are authorized to 
provide to law enforcement officials, regulatory agencies, and other 
entities or individuals duly authorized by Federal, State, or foreign 
governments, records of the Subcommittee's investigation into the 
United Nations ``Oil-for-Food'' Programme.
                                 <all>
