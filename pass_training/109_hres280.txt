[H. Res. 280 Engrossed in House (EH)]


                 In the House of Representatives, U.S.,

                                                          May 23, 2005.
Whereas the contributions of Asian Pacific Americans to our Nation have been 
        historically significant;
Whereas at the direction of Congress in 1978, the President proclaimed the week 
        of May 4 through 10, 1979, as Asian Pacific American Heritage Week, to 
        provide the people of the United States with an opportunity to recognize 
        the achievements, contributions, history, and concerns of Asian Pacific 
        Americans;
Whereas this seven day period designated Asian Pacific American Heritage Week 
        intended to mark two historical dates--May 7, 1843, when the first 
        Japanese immigrants arrived in the United States, and May 10, 1869, 
        Golden Spike Day, when, with substantial contributions from Chinese 
        immigrants, the first transcontinental railroad was completed;
Whereas in 1992, Congress by law designated that the month of May be annually 
        observed as Asian Pacific American Heritage Month;
Whereas according to the U.S. Census Bureau an estimated 14.5 million United 
        States residents trace their ethnic heritage, in full or in part, to 
        Asia and the Pacific Islands;
Whereas Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders can list innovative contributions 
        to all aspects of life in the United States ranging from the first 
        transcontinental railroad to the Internet;
Whereas in the mid-1700's Filipino sailors formed the first Asian American and 
        Pacific Islander communities in the bayous of Louisiana;
Whereas Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have added to the vast cultural 
        wealth of our Nation; and
Whereas more than 300,000 Americans of Asian or Pacific Island heritage have 
        bravely and honorably served to defend the United States in times of 
        armed conflict from the Civil War to the present: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved,  That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes that the United States draws its strength from its 
        diversity, including contributions made by Asian Americans and Pacific 
        Islanders;
            (2) recognizes that the Asian American and Pacific Islander 
        community is a thriving and integral part of American society and 
        culture;
            (3) recognizes the prodigious contributions of Asian Americans and 
        Pacific Islanders to the United States; and
            (4) supports the goals of Asian Pacific American Heritage Month.
            Attest:

                                                                          Clerk.
