SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--
            (1) one of the primary missions of the Federal Housing 
        Administration (FHA) single family mortgage insurance program 
        is to reach borrowers who are underserved, or not served, by 
        the existing conventional mortgage marketplace;
            (2) the FHA program has a long history of innovation, which 
        includes pioneering the 30-year self-amortizing mortgage and a 
        safe-to-seniors reverse mortgage product, both of which were 
        once thought too risky to private lenders;
            (3) the FHA single family mortgage insurance program 
        traditionally has been a major provider of mortgage insurance 
        for home purchases;
            (4) the FHA mortgage insurance premium structure, as well 
        as FHA's product offerings, should be revised to reflect FHA's 
        enhanced ability to determine risk at the loan level and to 
        allow FHA to better respond to changes in the mortgage market;
            (5) during past recessions, including the oil-patch 
        downturns in the mid-1980s, FHA remained a viable credit 
        enhancer and was therefore instrumental in preventing a more 
        catastrophic collapse in housing markets and a greater loss of 
        homeowner equity; and
            (6) as housing price appreciation slows and interest rates 
        rise, many homeowners and prospective homebuyers will need the 
        less-expensive, safer financing alternative that FHA mortgage 
        insurance provides.
    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--
            (1) to provide flexibility to FHA to allow for the 
        insurance of housing loans for low- and moderate-income 
        homebuyers during all economic cycles in the mortgage market;
            (2) to modernize the FHA single family mortgage insurance 
        program by making it more reflective of enhancements to loan-
        level risk assessments and changes to the mortgage market; and
            (3) to adjust the loan limits for the single family 
        mortgage insurance program to reflect rising house prices and 
        the increased costs associated with new construction.

SEC. 3. MAXIMUM PRINCIPAL LOAN OBLIGATION.

    Paragraph (2) of section 203(b) of the National Housing Act (12 
U.S.C. 1709(b)(2)) is amended--

                        determined by the Secretary; and in the case of 
                        a 2-, 3-, or 4-family residence, the percentage 
                        of such median price that bears the same ratio

                        family residence, respectively, bears to the 
                        dollar amount limitation in effect under such 
                        section for a 1-family residence; or

                except that the dollar amount limitation in effect for 
                any area under this subparagraph may not be less than 
                the greater of (I) the dollar amount limitation in 
                effect under this section for the area on October 21, 
                1998, or (II) 65 percent of the dollar limitation 
                determined under such section 305(a)(2) for a residence 
                of the applicable size; and

                inspection and other fees in connection with the 
                mortgage as approved by the Secretary.'';
            (2) in the matter after and below subparagraph (B), by

        ``average closing cost'') and all that follows through ``title 
        38, United States Code''; and
            (3) by striking the last undesignated paragraph (relating 
        to counseling with respect to the responsibilities and 
        financial management involved in homeownership).

SEC. 4. EXTENSION OF MORTGAGE TERM.

     Paragraph (3) of section 203(b) of the National Housing Act (12

        years''; and
            (2) by striking ``(or thirty years if such mortgage is not 
        approved for insurance prior to construction)''.

SEC. 5. CASH INVESTMENT REQUIREMENT.

    Paragraph (9) of section 203(b) of the National Housing Act (12 
U.S.C. 1709(b)(9) is amended by striking the paragraph designation and 
all that follows through ``Provided further, That for'' and inserting 
the following:
            ``(9) Be executed by a mortgagor who shall have paid on 
        account of the property, in cash or its equivalent, an amount, 
        if any, as the Secretary may determine based on factors 
        determined by the Secretary and commensurate with the 
        likelihood of default. For''.

SEC. 6. TEMPORARY REINSTATEMENT OF DOWNPAYMENT REQUIREMENT IN EVENT OF 
              INCREASED DEFAULTS.

    Section 203(b) of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1709(b)) is 
amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph:
            ``(10) Effect of increased defaults.--
                    ``(A) Annual determination.--If, for any calendar

SEC. 7. MORTGAGE INSURANCE PREMIUMS.

     Section 203(c) of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1709(c)) is 
amended--
            (1) in paragraph (2), in the matter preceding subparagraph 
        (A), by striking ``Notwithstanding'' and inserting ``Except as 
        provided in paragraph (3) and notwithstanding''; and
            (2) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:
    ``(3) Flexible Risk-Based Premiums.--
            ``(A) In general.--For any mortgage insured by the 
        Secretary under this title that is secured by a 1- to 4-family 
        dwelling and for which the loan application is received by the 
        mortgagee on or after October 1, 2006, the Secretary may 
        establish a mortgage insurance premium structure involving a 
        single premium payment collected prior to the insurance of the 
        mortgage or annual payments (which may be collected on a 
        periodic basis), or both, subject to the limitations in 
        subparagraphs (B) and (C). The rate of premium for such a 
        mortgage may vary during the mortgage term as long as the basis 
        for determining the variable rate is established before the 
        execution of the mortgage. The Secretary may change a premium 
        structure established under this subparagraph but only to the 
        extent that such change is not applied to any mortgage already 
        executed.
            ``(B) Maximum up-front premium amounts.--For any mortgage 
        insured under a premium structure established pursuant to this

                equivalent to a FICO score of 560 or more and has paid

        shall provide for an independent actuarial study of the Fund to

                financial soundness of the Fund is maintained.

SEC. 17. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING TECHNOLOGY FOR FINANCIAL SYSTEMS.

    (a) Congressional Findings.--The Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Government Accountability Office has cited the FHA 
        single family housing mortgage insurance program as a ``high-
        risk'' program, with a primary reason being non-integrated and 
        out-dated financial management systems.
            (2) The ``Audit of the Federal Housing Administration's 
        Financial Statements for Fiscal Years 2004 and 2003'', 
        conducted by the Inspector General of the Department of Housing 
        and Urban Development reported as a material weakness that 
        ``HUD/FHA's automated data processing [ADP] system environment 
        must be enhanced to more effectively support FHA's business and 
        budget processes''.
            (3) Existing technology systems for the FHA program have 
        not been updated to meet the latest standards of the Mortgage 
        Industry Standards Maintenance Organization and have numerous 
        deficiencies that lenders have outlined.
            (4) Improvements to technology used in the FHA program 
        will--
                    (A) allow the FHA program to improve the management 
                of the FHA portfolio, garner greater efficiencies in 
                its operations, and lower costs across the program;
                    (B) result in efficiencies and lower costs for 
                lenders participating in the program, allowing them to 
                better use the FHA products in extending homeownership 
                opportunities to higher credit risk or lower-income 
                families, in a sound manner.
            (5) The Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund operates without 
        cost to the taxpayers and generates revenues for the Federal 
        Government.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that--
            (1) the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development should 
        use a portion of the funds received from premiums paid for FHA 
        single family housing mortgage insurance that are in excess of 
        the amounts paid out in claims to substantially increase the 
        funding for technology used in such FHA program;
            (2) the goal of this investment should be to bring the 
        technology used in such FHA program to the level and 
        sophistication of the technology used in the conventional 
        mortgage lending market, or to exceed such level; and
            (3) the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development should 
        report to the Congress not later than 180 days after the date 
        of the enactment of this Act regarding the progress the 
        Department is making toward such goal and if progress is not 
        sufficient, the resources needed to make greater progress.
