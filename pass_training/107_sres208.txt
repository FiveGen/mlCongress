Commending students who participated in the United States Senate Youth 
                     Program between 1962 and 2002.

Whereas the students who have participated in the United States Senate Youth 
        Program (referred to in this resolution as the ``Senate Youth Program'') 
        over the past 40 years were chosen for their exceptional merit and 
        interest in the political process;
Whereas the students demonstrated outstanding leadership abilities and a strong 
        commitment to community service and have ranked academically in the top 
        1 percent of their States;
Whereas the Senate Youth Program alumni have continued to achieve unparalleled 
        success in their education and careers and have demonstrated a strong 
        commitment to public service on the local, State, national, and global 
        levels;
Whereas the Senate Youth Program alumni have reflected excellent qualities of 
        citizenship and have contributed to the Nation's constitutional 
        democracy, be it in either professional or volunteer capacities, and 
        have made an indelible impression on their communities;
Whereas the chief State school officers, on behalf of the State Departments of 
        Education, have selected outstanding participants for the Senate Youth 
        Program;
Whereas the Department of Defense, Department of State, and other Federal 
        Departments, as well as Congress, have offered support and provided top 
        level speakers who have inspired and educated the students of the Senate 
        Youth Program; and
Whereas the directors of the William Randolph Hearst Foundation have continually 
        made the Senate Youth Program available for outstanding young students 
        and exposed them to the varied aspects of public service: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate congratulates, honors, and pays tribute 
to the more than 4,000 exemplary students who have been selected, on 
their merit, to participate in the United States Senate Youth Program 
between 1962 and 2002.
