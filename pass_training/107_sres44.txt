                               RESOLUTION


 
          Designating March 2002 as ``Arts Education Month''.

Whereas the Congressional Recognition for Excellence in Arts Education Act 
        (Public Law 106-533) was approved by the 106th Congress by unanimous 
        consent;
Whereas arts literacy is a fundamental purpose of schooling for all students;
Whereas arts education stimulates, develops and refines many cognitive and 
        creative skills, critical thinking and nimbleness in judgment, 
        creativity and imagination, cooperative decisionmaking, leadership, 
        high-level literacy and communication, and the capacity for problem 
        posing and problem-solving;
Whereas arts education contributes significantly to the creation of flexible, 
        adaptable, and knowledgeable workers who will be needed in the 21st 
        century economy;
Whereas arts education improves teaching and learning;
Whereas when parents and families, artists, arts organizations, businesses, 
        local civic and cultural leaders, and institutions are actively engaged 
        in instructional programs, arts education is more successful;
Whereas effective teachers of the arts should be encouraged to continue to learn 
        and grow in mastery of their art form as well as in their teaching 
        competence;
Whereas educators, schools, students, and other community members recognize the 
        importance of arts education; and
Whereas arts programs, arts curriculum, and other arts activities in schools 
        across the Nation should be encouraged and publicly recognized: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved,
