                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing the sense of the Senate concerning an international project 
   to evaluate and facilitate the international exchange of advanced 
                             technologies.

Whereas currently in the post Cold-War world, there are new opportunities to 
        facilitate international political and scientific cooperation on cost-
        effective and advanced innovative nuclear waste technologies;
Whereas there is increasing public interest in monitoring and remediation of 
        nuclear wastes; and
Whereas it is in the best interest of the United States to explore and develop 
        options with the international community to facilitate the exchange of 
        evolving advanced nuclear waste technologies: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) the President should instruct the Secretary of Energy, 
        in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of 
        Defense, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection 
        Agency, and other officials as appropriate, to consider the 
        Advanced Technology Research Project (known as ``ATRP'') and 
        report to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the 
        Senate on--
                    (A) whether the United States should encourage the 
                establishment of an international project to facilitate 
                the evaluation and international exchange of data 
                (including cost data) relating to advanced nuclear 
                waste technologies, including technologies for solid 
                and liquid radioactive wastes and contaminated soils 
                and sediments;
                    (B) whether such a project could be funded 
                privately through industry, public interest, and 
                scientific organizations and administered by an 
                international non-governmental, nonprofit organization, 
                with operations in the United States, Russia, Japan, 
                and other countries that have an interest in developing 
                such technologies; and
                    (C) any legislation that the Secretary believes 
                would be required to enable such a project to be 
                undertaken.
                                 <all>
