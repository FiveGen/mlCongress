                               RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing the sense of the Senate regarding the establishment of a 
                      National Words Can Heal Day.

Whereas the Jerusalem Fund has launched the Words Can Heal Campaign on September 
        4, 2001, to reduce verbal violence and gossip and to promote the value 
        and practice of ethical speech in order to improve our democracy, build 
        mutual respect, honor, and dignity in our country;
Whereas words used unfairly, whether expressed through excessive anger, unfair 
        criticism, public and private humiliation, bigoted comments, cruel 
        jokes, or rumors and malicious gossip, can traumatize and damage many 
        lives;
Whereas an unwillingness or inability of many parents to control what they say 
        when angry causes the infliction of potentially damaging verbal abuse on 
        children;
Whereas bigoted words are often used to dehumanize entire religious, racial, and 
        ethnic groups, and can inflame hostility;
Whereas the spreading of negative and often unfair, untrue, or exaggerated 
        comments or rumors about others often inflicts irrevocable damage on the 
        victim of such rumors;
Whereas the Words Can Heal Campaign will raise awareness regarding the damage 
        that can be caused by destructive language; and
Whereas the Senate supports the goals of the Words Can Heal Campaign: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) the Senate supports the goals of the Words Can Heal 
        Campaign; and
            (2) the President should issue a proclamation calling on 
        the people of the United States to support the goals of such 
        campaign with appropriate programs and activities.
                                 <all>
