                               RESOLUTION


 
     Recognizing the 100th anniversary of Mesa Verde National Park.

Whereas Mesa Verde National Park was created 100 years ago by an Act of Congress 
        and signed into law by President Theodore Roosevelt on June 29, 1906, as 
        the first National Park set aside to preserve the works of humankind;
Whereas the more than 5,000 archeological sites, including over 600 cliff 
        dwellings, protected within the 52,000-acre boundary of Mesa Verde 
        National Park represent some of the most spectacular and best-preserved 
        prehistoric architecture in the world;
Whereas in 1928, Congress declared the natural resources of Mesa Verde National 
        Park to be of such caliber as to be worthy of the same level of 
        protection as the cultural resources therein;
Whereas 8,500 acres within Mesa Verde National Park were designated as 
        wilderness by Congress on October 20, 1976;
Whereas on September 8, 1978, the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and 
        Cultural Organization (``UNESCO'') declared Mesa Verde National Park to 
        be 1 of 8 original World Cultural Heritage Sites;
Whereas Mesa Verde National Park is part of our American heritage that is 
        universally recognized and shared with the world;
Whereas Mesa Verde National Park is the primary driving force behind the economy 
        of southwestern Colorado and the Four Corners Region;
Whereas the communities of Cortez, Dolores, Mancos, and Durango, Colorado, have 
        come together to plan a year-long celebration worthy of this magnificent 
        icon of the National Park System; and
Whereas 24 American Indian tribes recognize Mesa Verde as their ancestral home 
        and contribute a rich cultural heritage to the experience of visitors to 
        the region: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes the 100th anniversary of Mesa Verde National 
        Park; and
            (2) urges all citizens of the United States to join in the 
        Centennial Celebration of Mesa Verde National Park by 
        participating in the many activities planned throughout the 
        year in 2006.
