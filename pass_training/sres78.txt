                               RESOLUTION


 
To designate April 30, 1997, as ``National Erase the Hate and Eliminate 
                             Racism Day''.

Whereas the term ``hate crime'' means an offense in which one or more 
        individuals, commits an offense (such as an assault or battery (simple 
        or aggravated), theft, criminal trespass, damage to property, mob 
        action, disorderly conduct, or telephone harassment) by reason of the 
        race, color, creed, religion, ancestry, gender, sexual orientation, 
        physical or mental disability, or national origin of another individual 
        or group of individuals;
Whereas there are almost 8,000 hate crimes reported to the Department of Justice 
        each year, and the number of hate crimes reported increases each year;
Whereas hate crimes have no place in a civilized society that is dedicated to 
        freedom and independence, as is the United States;
Whereas the people of the United States must lead and set the example for the 
        world in protecting the rights of all people;
Whereas the people of the United States should take personal responsibility for 
        and action against hatred and hate crimes;
Whereas the Members of Congress, as representatives of the people of the United 
        States, must take personal responsibility for and action against hatred 
        and hate crimes;
Whereas the laws against hate crimes, which have been passed by Congress and 
        signed by the President, must be supported and implemented by the people 
        of the United States and by Federal, State, and local law enforcement 
        officials and other public servants: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates April 30, 1997, as ``National Erase the Hate 
        and Eliminate Racism Day''; and
            (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation 
        calling upon the people of the United States and throughout the 
        world to recognize the importance of using each day as an 
        opportunity to take a stand against hate crimes and violence in 
        their nations, states, neighborhoods, and communities.
                                 <all>
