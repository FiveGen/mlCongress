        weapons or other illicit materials to keep such weapons and materials 
        out of the hands of dangerous actors and terrorists;
Whereas, since Croatia has become an independent country, the United States has

                indicted for war crimes, including Ante Gotovina, to 
                the Tribunal;

                to assist Croatia in the reform process and in 
                fulfilling its requirements for membership in NATO; and
            (4) upon complete satisfaction of the criteria for NATO 
        membership, in accordance with NATO's guidelines, Croatia
