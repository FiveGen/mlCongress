                               RESOLUTION


 
 Designating the month of November 1997 as ``National American Indian 
                           Heritage Month''.

Whereas American Indians and Alaska Natives were the original inhabitants of the 
        land that now constitutes the United States;
Whereas American Indian tribal governments developed the fundamental principles 
        of freedom of speech and separation of powers that form the foundation 
        of the United States Government;
Whereas American Indians and Alaska Natives have traditionally exhibited a 
        respect for the finiteness of natural resources through a reverence for 
        the earth;
Whereas American Indians and Alaska Natives have served with valor in all of 
        America's wars beginning with the Revolutionary War through the conflict 
        in the Persian Gulf, and often the percentage of American Indians who 
        served exceeded significantly the percentage of American Indians in the 
        population of the United States as a whole;
Whereas American Indians and Alaska Natives have made distinct and important 
        contributions to the United States and the rest of the world in many 
        fields, including agriculture, medicine, music, language, and art;
Whereas American Indians and Alaska Natives deserve to be recognized for their 
        individual contributions to the United States as local and national 
        leaders, artists, athletes, and scholars;
Whereas this recognition will encourage self-esteem, pride, and self-awareness 
        in American Indians and Alaska Natives of all ages; and
Whereas November is a time when many Americans commemorate a special time in the 
        history of the United States when American Indians and English settlers 
        celebrated the bounty of their harvest and the promise of new kinships: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate designates November 1997 as ``National 
American Indian Heritage Month'' and requests that the President issue 
a proclamation calling on the Federal Government and State and local 
governments, interested groups and organizations, and the people of the 
United States to observe the month with appropriate programs, 
ceremonies, and activities.
                                 <all>
