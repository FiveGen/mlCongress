  Congratulating President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga and the 
    people of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka on the

Whereas February 4, 1998, is the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the 
        independence of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka from 
        Britain;
Whereas the present constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri

        universal suffrage; and
Whereas the people of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka and the 
        United States share many values, including a common belief in democratic 
        principles, a commitment to international cooperation, and promotion of 
        enhanced trade and cultural ties: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) congratulates President Chandrika Bandaranaike 
        Kumaratunga and the people of the Democratic Socialist Republic 
        of Sri Lanka on the celebration of 50 years of independence;
            (2) expresses best wishes to the Government and people of 
        the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka as they 
        celebrate their national day of independence on February 4, 
        1998; and
            (3) looks forward to continued cooperation and friendship 
        with the Government and people of the Democratic Socialist 
        Republic of Sri Lanka in the years ahead.
