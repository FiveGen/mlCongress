        <DELETED>    (2) The Government of the People's Republic of 
        China demonstrated that maintaining its monopoly on political 
        power is a higher priority than economic development by 
        announcing in January 1996 that its official news agency 
        Xinhua, will supervise wire services selling economic 
        information, including Dow Jones-Telerate, Bloomberg, and

        <DELETED>    (3) Under the May 30, 1997, order of Premier Li 
        Peng, all organizations that engage in business activities 
        related to international computer networking must now apply for 
        a license, increasing still further government control over 
        access to the internet.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (4) Both Radio Free Asia and the Voice of America, 
        as a surrogate for a free press in the People's Republic of 
        China, provide an invaluable source of uncensored information 
        to the Chinese people, including objective and authoritative 
        news of in-country and regional events, as well as accurate 
        news about the United States and its policies.</DELETED>

        Tibetan, as well as further broadcasting capability in the 
        dialects spoken in the People's Republic of China.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (8) Radio Free Asia and Voice of America, in 
        working toward continuously broadcasting to the People's

        immediately establish 24-hour-a-day Mandarin broadcasting to 
        that nation by staggering the hours of Radio Free Asia and 
        Voice of America.</DELETED>
