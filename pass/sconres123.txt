                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
  To express the sense of Congress regarding the policy of the Forest 
  Service toward recreational shooting and archery ranges on Federal 
                                 land.

Whereas the Forest Service is developing a national policy to guide its 
        management of existing and proposed shooting and archery ranges on 
        national forest land;
Whereas when managed appropriately, firearm and archery sports are a legitimate 
        use of national forest land;
Whereas the Forest Service has proceeded with closure actions of recreational 
        shooting ranges on Forest Service land without prior notification to 
        Congress or the general public;
Whereas on March 10, 1997, the Forest Service suspended the special-use permit 
        of the Tucson Rod and Gun Club located in the Coronado National Forest 
        near Tucson, Arizona; and
Whereas the Forest Service is evaluating alternative sites in the Coronado 
        National Forest that could be used by the Tucson Rod and Gun Club for 
        firearm and archery sports, the Secretary of Agriculture has directed 
        the expeditious completion of the environmental assessment, and the 
        Forest Service has committed to notify Congress of its decision by 
        November 20, 1998: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring), 

SECTION 1. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING PUBLIC RECREATIONAL AND MULTI-
              PURPOSE USE OF UNITED STATES FOREST SERVICE LAND.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Forest Service should not close shooting or archery 
        facilities without prior notification to Congress and the 
        general public unless there is an immediate threat to public 
        safety;
            (2) notification to Congress of any plan for closure of a 
        shooting or archery facility should include the reasons for the 
        closure, including any potential for imminent public safety 
        endangerment;
            (3) the Forest Service should avoid unreasonable 
        restrictions in the issuance of special-use permits for firearm 
        and archery sports facilities;
            (4) the Forest Service should fully evaluate alternative 
        sites in the Coronado National Forest and provide, to the 
        extent consistent with the environmental assessment, a 
        reasonable alternative that would allow the Tucson Rod and Gun 
        Club to quickly open a safe facility for firearm and archery 
        sports; and
            (5) the Forest Service should adhere to its deadline of 
        November 20, 1998, for a decision on a site for the Tucson Rod 
        and Gun Club.

            Passed the Senate October 12 (legislative day, October 2), 
      1998.

            Attest:

                                                    GARY SISCO,

                                                             Secretary.
