                TITLE XXXVII--FORCED OR INDENTURED LABOR

SEC. 3701. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The United States Customs Service has identified goods, 
        wares, articles, and merchandise mined, produced, or 
        manufactured under conditions of convict labor, forced labor, 
        or indentured labor, in several countries.
            (2) The United States Customs Service has made limited 
        attempts to prohibit the import of products made with forced 
        labor, resulting in only a few seizures, detention orders, 
        fines, and criminal prosecutions.
            (3) The United States Customs Service has taken 21 formal 
        administrative actions in the form of detention orders against 
        different products destined for the United States market, found 
        to have been made with forced labor, including products from 
        the People's Republic of China.
            (4) However, the United States Customs Service has never 
        formally investigated or pursued enforcement with respect to 
        attempts to import products made with forced or indentured 
        child labor.
            (5) The United States Customs Service can use additional 
        resources and tools to obtain the timely and in-depth 
        verification necessary to identify and interdict products made 
        with forced labor or indentured labor, including forced or 
        indentured child labor, that are destined for the United States 
        market.
            (6) The International Labor Organization estimates that 
        approximately 250,000,000 children between the ages of 5 and 14 
        are working in developing countries, including millions of 
        children in bondage or otherwise forced to work for little or 
        no pay.
            (7) Congress has clearly indicated in Public Law 105-61, 
        Treasury-Postal Service Appropriations, 1998, that forced or 
        indentured child labor constitutes forced labor under section 
        307 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1307).

SEC. 3702. AUTHORIZATION FOR ADDITIONAL CUSTOMS PERSONNEL TO MONITOR 
              THE IMPORTATION OF PRODUCTS MADE WITH FORCED OR 
              INDENTURED LABOR.

    There are authorized to be appropriated $2,000,000 for fiscal year 
1999 to the United States Customs Service to monitor the importation of 
products made with forced labor or indentured labor, including forced 
or indentured child labor, the importation of which violates section 
307 of the Tariff Act of 1930 or section 1761 of title 18, United 
States Code.

SEC. 3703. REPORTING REQUIREMENT ON FORCED LABOR OR INDENTURED LABOR 
              PRODUCTS DESTINED FOR THE UNITED STATES MARKET.

    (a) Report to Congress.--Not later than 1 year after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the Commissioner of Customs shall prepare and 
transmit to Congress a report on products made with forced labor or 
indentured labor, including forced or indentured child labor that are 
destined for the United States market.
    (b) Contents of Report.--The report under subsection (a) shall 
include information concerning the following:
            (1) The extent of the use of forced labor or indentured 
        labor, including forced or indentured child labor in 
        manufacturing or mining products destined for the United States 
        market.
            (2) The volume of products made or mined with forced labor 
        or indentured labor, including forced or indentured child labor 
        that is--
                    (A) destined for the United States market,
                    (B) in violation of section 307 of the Tariff Act 
                of 1930 or section 1761 of title 18, United States 
                Code, and
                    (C) seized by the United States Customs Service.
            (3) The progress of the United States Customs Service in 
        identifying and interdicting products made with forced labor or 
        indentured labor, including forced or indentured child labor 
        that are destined for the United States market.

SEC. 3704. RENEGOTIATING MEMORANDA OF UNDERSTANDING ON FORCED LABOR.

    It is the sense of Congress that the President should determine 
whether any country with which the United States has a memorandum of 
understanding with respect to reciprocal trade that involves goods made 
with forced labor or indentured labor, including forced or indentured 
child labor is frustrating implementation of the memorandum. If an 
affirmative determination be made, the President should immediately 
commence negotiations to replace the current memorandum of 
understanding with one providing for effective procedures for the 
monitoring of forced labor or indentured labor, including forced or 
indentured child labor. The memorandum of understanding should include 
improved procedures for requesting investigations of suspected work 
sites by international monitors.

                     TITLE XXXIX --RADIO FREE ASIA

SEC. 3901. SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``Radio Free Asia Act of 1998''.

SEC. 3902. FINDINGS.

    The Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Government of the People's Republic of China 
        systematically controls the flow of information to the Chinese 
        people.
            (2) The Government of the People's Republic of China 
        demonstrated that maintaining its monopoly on political power 
        is a higher priority than economic development by announcing in 
        January 1996 that its official news agency, Xinhua, will 
        supervise wire services selling economic information, including 
        Dow Jones-Telerate, Bloomberg, and Reuters Business, and in 
        announcing in February 1996 the ``Interim Internet Management 
        Rules'', which have the effect of censoring computer networks.
            (3) Under the May 30, 1997, order of Premier Li Peng, all 
        organizations that engage in business activities related to 
        international computer networking must now apply for a license, 
        increasing still further government control over access to the 
        Internet.
            (4) Both Radio Free Asia and the Voice of America, as a 
        surrogate for a free press in the People's Republic of China, 
        provide an invaluable source of uncensored information to the 
        Chinese people, including objective and authoritative news of 
        in-country and regional events, as well as accurate news about 
        the United States and its policies.
            (5) Enhanced broadcasting service to China and Tibet can 
        efficiently be established through a combination of Radio Free 
        Asia and Voice of America programming.
            (6) Radio Free Asia and Voice of America, in working toward 
        continuously broadcasting to the People's Republic of China in 
        multiple languages, have the capability to establish 24-hour-a-
        day Mandarin broadcasting to that nation by staggering the 
        hours of Radio Free Asia and Voice of America.
            (7) Simultaneous broadcastings on Voice of America radio 
        and Worldnet television 7 days a week in Mandarin are also 
        important and needed capabilities.

SEC. 3903. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS FOR INCREASED FUNDING FOR

            (2) Limitations.--Of the funds under paragraph (1) 
        authorized to be appropriated for fiscal year 1998, $8,000,000 
        is authorized to be appropriated for one-time capital costs.
            (3) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress that of 
        the funds under paragraph (1), a significant amount shall be 
        directed towards broadcasting to China and Tibet in the 
        appropriate languages and dialects.
    (b) Authorization of Appropriations for International Broadcasting 
to China.--In addition to such sums as are otherwise authorized to be
