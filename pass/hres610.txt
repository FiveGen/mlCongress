                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the people of 
the Republic of Mozambique are to be commended for their commitment to 
rebuilding their nation after years of civil war, their willingness to 
  live together harmoniously despite sharp political differences, and 
their ability to overcome poverty, health crises, and refugee outflows 
  to build a growing economy and a positive future for their country.

Whereas the Republic of Mozambique suffered from armed conflict for 30 years, 
        first against Portuguese colonialism and then a brutal civil war between 
        the FRELIMO government and RENAMO rebels;
Whereas up to one-third of Mozambique's 17,000,000 people were forced to flee 
        their homes as refugees or internal displaced persons as a result of the 
        civil war;
Whereas the two sides to the civil conflict reached a peace accord in 1992 and 
        democratic elections were held in 1994 with the participation of all 
        major political groups;
Whereas both the government of President Joachim Alberto Chissano and opposition 
        parties have participated positively in Mozambique's representative 
        democracy;
Whereas both the government and the opposition have made considerable strides in 
        building a defense force that is representative of the Mozambican 
        people;
Whereas Mozambique has rejected its communist economic policies, embraced free 
        market principles, privatized many state enterprises, encouraged foreign 
        investment and now enjoys one of Africa's highest economic growth rates 
        at 8 percent per year; and
Whereas Mozambique is a fertile market for United States investment and trade: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes the achievements of the Mozambican people in 
        overcoming political and economic obstacles to become a model 
        of reconciliation and development;
            (2) applauds those who have led Mozambique toward political 
        reconciliation and away from armed conflict;
            (3) commends the people of Mozambique for continuing to 
        support democracy and democratic institutions;
            (4) calls upon United States Government agencies to 
        continue to work with their Mozambican counterparts in forging 
        a close bilateral relationship;
            (5) calls on the Government of Mozambique to continue to be 
        a model of democracy, economic liberalization, and respect for 
        human rights; and
            (6) calls those nations in the world torn by civil strife 
        to look toward the example of Mozambique for the benefits of 
        political reconciliation and peaceful economic development.
