[From the U.S. Government Printing Office]
[H. Res. 175 Engrossed in House (EH)]


                 In the House of Representatives, U.S.,

                                                         July 28, 1997.
Whereas President Pascal Lissouba defeated former President Denis Sassou-Nguesso 
        in a 1992 election that was determined to be free and fair;
Whereas losing candidates raised questions concerning the results of the 1993 
        legislative election and used those concerns to cast doubt on the entire 
        democratic process in the Republic of Congo and as the rationale for 
        creating private militias;
Whereas thousands of citizens of the Republic of Congo have been killed in 
        intermittent fighting between Government soldiers and private militiamen 
        since 1993;
Whereas there are concerns about the unfinished census and resulting electoral 
        list to be used in the scheduled July 27 election;
Whereas the recent fighting resulted from the Government's attempt to disarm 
        former President Sassou-Nguesso's ``Cobra'' militia in advance of the 
        scheduled July 27 election;
Whereas the fighting and uneasy peace has caused serious loss of life and 
        diminished ability to care for those who are without access to adequate 
        medical care or food and water;
Whereas the fighting between Government troops and militiamen have forced the 
        evacuation from the country of foreign nationals and endangered refugees 
        from both Rwanda and the former Zaire; and
Whereas African governments have attempted to bring about a negotiated 
        settlement to the current crisis: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) condemns the current fighting and urges the warring 
        parties to reach a lasting ceasefire that will allow for 
        humanitarian needs to be addressed as soon as possible;
            (2) calls on all private militia to disarm and disband 
        immediately to end the continuing threat to peace and stability 
        in the Republic of Congo;
            (3) commends African leaders from Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, 
        Cameroon, Benin, Central African Republic, Senegal, and Chad 
        for their efforts to negotiate a peaceful settlement and 
        encourages their continuing efforts to find a sustainable 
        political settlement in this matter;
            (4) supports the deployment of an African peacekeeping 
        force to the Republic of Congo if deemed necessary;
            (5) urges the Government of the Republic of Congo, in 
        cooperation with all legal political parties, to resolve in a 
        transparent manner questions concerning the scheduled elections 
        and to prepare for open and transparent elections at the 
        earliest feasible time; and
            (6) encourages the United States Government to provide 
        technical assistance on election related matters if requested 
        by the Government of the Republic of Congo.

            Attest:

                                                                 Clerk.
