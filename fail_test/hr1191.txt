SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) The largest category of health spending is hospital 
        services; in 1994, 35 percent of national health spending was 
        for hospital services worth $338,500,000,000.
            (2) The hospital industry exhibits the fastest rising costs 
        in the health care sector.
            (3) The largest expenditures for the hospital industry are 
        payroll (wages and salaries) and employee benefits; in 1992, 
        payroll and employee benefits accounted for almost 55 percent 
        of total hospital expenses.
            (4) Because registered nurses and licensed practical nurses 
        comprise the majority of a hospital's expenses, in an effort to 
        remain competitive, hospitals are restructuring their 
        operations by decreasing payroll and benefit outlays for 
        registered nurses and licensed practical nurses and either 
        decreasing their number or replacing them with unlicensed aides 
        to care directly for patients.
            (5) While this reorganization is taking place, no 
        mandatory, national, and systematic compilation of data is 
        being undertaken to determine the correlation between skilled 
        nursing care and patient safety.
            (6) Several studies, however, have noted a basic 
        relationship between skilled nursing care and patient safety: 
        increased deaths result when inadequate nursing and lower 
        levels of registered nurses and licensed practical nurses in 
        combination with higher levels of unlicensed aides are utilized 
        by health care facilities.
            (7) A comprehensive effort is needed at the national level 
        to collect data and develop a research and evaluation agenda so 
        that informed policy development, implementation and evaluation 
        are undertaken in a timely manner to protect the safety of 
        patients, the well being of health care workers, and the 
        integrity of the United States medical system.
            (8) The quality of available health care will suffer in the 
        United States if health care delivery is allowed to set 
        priorities in which profit is made at the expense of patient 
        care quality and safety.
            (9) Core clinical staff, such as registered nurses and 
        licensed practical nurses, are a key component in increasing 
        quality, understanding patient care needs, and balancing costs 
        in any reformed health care system.
            (10) Health care is a basic and universal need; therefore, 
        the right of any consumer to have access to one's own 
        confidential medical records and pertinent information on the 
        health care facility that is delivering health care and to 
        participate effectively in the process of improving the 
        delivery and quality of such care should not be impaired.

            (2) Safe staffing levels.--
                    (A) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the 
                date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall,

                and classifications of health care providers necessary 
                to ensure safe and adequate staffing in relation to 
                enrollees under a health plan.
                    (B) Factors.--Such guidelines shall be based on--
                            (i) the severity of illness of each

            (3) Safe and adequate staffing levels.--
                    (A) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the 
                date the Secretary establishes the guidelines under 
                paragraph (2), a health plan may not provide or pay for 
                health care services provided to an enrollee at an 
                institution unless such institution complies with such 
                guidelines.
                    (B) Submission of proposed standards to 
                committee.--In the case of an institution that elects 
                not to adopt the guidelines established under paragraph

                levels to the health plan and its Committee for review.

                proposed by such institution fail to meet the 
                guidelines established under paragraph (2), then the 
                health plan may not provide or pay for health care 
                services provided to an enrollee at such institution 
                unless such institution adopts such guidelines as its 
                staffing levels.

                plan shall file with the Secretary and the Office of

                adopted by the institutions where the plan provides or 
                pays for health care services for its enrollees.
                    (E) Public inspection.--Such institutions shall 
                keep on file, available for public inspection during 
                regular business hours, daily reports of staffing 
                levels by department and of patient census. Such 
                information shall also be posted in a public place.
            (4) Identification tag.--
                    (A) In general.--A health plan may not provide or 
                pay for health care services provided to an enrollee at 
                an institution unless such institution prohibits a 
                health care provider who is not wearing an 
                identification tag from providing care to an enrollee.
                    (B) Licensure status.--An identification tag under 
                subparagraph (A) shall state the health care provider's

                provider has been licensed or certified by the State.
                    (C) Visibility.--Such tag shall be visible to the

                    (D) Exception.--The requirement under subparagraph 
                (A) shall not apply where wearing such tag poses a 
                threat to the health of a patient (such as in an 
                operating room).
    (c) Data Collection.--
            (1) Medical data.--Except as provided in section 105(a), a 
        health plan, in conjunction with its Committee, shall compile 
        data on health care services provided to enrollees under the 
        health plan including--
                    (A) enrollee outcome information, including 
                nosocomial infections, medication errors, enrollee 
                injury, enrollee mortality, and rate of enrollee 
                readmission;
                    (B) structure of care provided, including nurse to 
                enrollee ratios, general staffing ratios, injuries to 
                nurses and other staff, and quality of staff; and
                    (C) process of care, including the planning and 
                delivery of care, an assessment of the delivery 
                mechanisms, and safety measures.

                    (A) Financial report.--Not later than September 
                30th of each year, a health plan that employs more than 
                150 individuals shall file, with the Office of the 
                State in which such plan offers health care services, a 
                copy of--
                            (i) any financial report or return filed
