SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Brownfields are parcels of land that contain or 
        contained abandoned or under-used commercial or industrial 
        facilities, the expansion or redevelopment of which is 
        complicated by the presence or potential presence of hazardous 
        substances, pollutants, or contaminants.
            (2) Brownfields, which may number in the hundreds of 
        thousands nationwide, threaten the environment, devalue 
        surrounding property, erode local tax bases, and prevent job 
        growth.
            (3) Despite potentially great productive value, prospective 
        developers may avoid brownfields because of the uncertainty of 
        cleanup and development costs, which leads to construction on 
        undeveloped so-called greenfield sites, contributing to urban 
        sprawl, creating infrastructure problems, and reducing the 
        amount of open spaces.
            (4) Cleanup and redevelopment of brownfields would reduce 
        environmental contamination, encourage job growth, and curb the 
        development of greenfields.
            (5) State voluntary programs to address environmental 
        contamination, and addressing liability concerns to encourage 
        developers and current owners to invest in brownfield sites, 
        can be very effective in promoting the cleanup and 
        redevelopment of brownfields.

                                the applicant.
                                    (II) A written statement that 
                                attests that the cleanup of the site 
                                would not occur without access to the 
                                revolving loan fund.
                                    (III) The proposed method, and

                                contamination at the brownfield site.
                                    (IV) An estimate of the proposed 
                                total cost of the cleanup to be 
                                conducted at the brownfield site.
                                    (V) An analysis that demonstrates 
                                the potential of the brownfield site 
                                for stimulating economic development or 
                                creation of recreational areas on 
                                completion of the cleanup of the

                government;
                    (B) the ability of the local government to ensure 
                that the applicants repay the loans in a timely manner;
                    (C) the extent to which the cleanup of the 
                brownfield site or sites would reduce health and 
                environmental risks caused by the release of hazardous 
                substances, pollutants, or contaminants at, or from, 
                the brownfield site or sites;
                    (D) the demonstrable potential of the brownfield 
                site or sites for stimulating economic development or 
                creation of recreational areas on completion of the 
                cleanup;
                    (E) the demonstrated ability of the local 
                government to administer such a loan program;
                    (F) the demonstrated experience of the local 
                government regarding brownfield sites and the reuse of 
                contaminated land, including whether the government has 
                received any grant under the Comprehensive 
                Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act 
                of 1980 (42 U.S.C. 9601 et seq.) to assess brownfield 
                sites, except that applicants who have not previously 
                received such a grant may be considered for awards 
                under this section;
                    (G) the experience of administering any loan 
                programs by the entity, including the loan repayment 
                rates;
                    (H) the demonstrations made regarding the ability 
                of the local government to ensure a fair distribution 
                of grant funds among brownfield sites within the 
                jurisdiction of the local government; and

        funded under the loan program of the local government shall be

``SEC. 127. STATE VOLUNTARY RESPONSE PROGRAMS.

    ``(a) Purposes and Objectives.--The purposes and objectives of this 
section are--
            ``(1) to significantly increase the pace of response

        response programs; and
            ``(2) to benefit the public health, welfare, and the 
        environment by cleaning up and returning contaminated sites to 
        economically productive or other beneficial uses.
    ``(b) Assistance to States.--The Administrator shall provide 
technical, financial, and other assistance to States to establish and 
enhance voluntary response programs. The Administrator shall encourage

    ``(c) Limitation on Federal Authority To List on National 
Priorities List.--Except as provided in subsection (e), the President 
shall not list on the National Priorities List the portion of a 
facility subject to a response action plan approved under a State 
program qualified under subsection (i)--
            ``(1) while substantial and continuous voluntary response 
        activities are being conducted in compliance with the plan at 
        that portion of the facility; or

site in compliance with a response action plan approved under a State 
program qualified under subsection (i) or if response activities 
conducted at such a site in compliance with the plan have been 
certified by the State as complete, then no person shall be liable to 
the Administrator under section 107(a) for response costs incurred with 
respect to a release or substantial threat of release of a hazardous 
substance addressed by the response action plan unless one or more of 
the following conditions is met:

            ``(C) Conditions at the site that were unknown to the State

President shall first conduct a study of commercial and industrial 
practices concerning environmental site assessments in the transfer of 
real property in the United States. Any such standards issued or 
designated by the President shall also be deemed to constitute 
commercially reasonable and generally accepted standards and practices
