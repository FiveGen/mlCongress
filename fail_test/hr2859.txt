To prohibit commercial air tours over the Rocky Mountain National Park.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Rocky Mountain National Park 
Overflights Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) the National Park Service manages the Rocky Mountain 
        National Park to conserve--
                    (A) scenery, natural, cultural and historic 
                resources and values of the park; and
                    (B) wilderness resources and values of the park, 
                including natural quiet and wildlife resources;
            (2) while carrying out the conservation objectives referred 
        to in paragraph (1), the National Park Service provides for the 
        enjoyment of the values referred to in that paragraph in a 
        manner and by a means that will leave those values unimpaired 
        for the enjoyment of future generations;
            (3) in order to manage the Rocky Mountain National Park to 
        achieve the purposes for which the park was established, it is 
        necessary to ban commercial air tours over the park;
            (4) the Federal Aviation Administration--
                    (A) manages the safe and efficient use of the 
                navigable airspace under subtitle VII of title 49, 
                United States Code; and
                    (B) protects the environment from adverse impacts 
                in accordance with sections 40103 and 44715 and 307 of 
                title 49, United States Code; and
            (5) the auditory and visual intrusion of aircraft flying at 
        low altitudes can be incompatible with the preservation and 
        management of natural or cultural resources, natural quiet, 
        scenery, and the enjoyment by the public of the resources of 
        the Rocky Mountain National Park.
