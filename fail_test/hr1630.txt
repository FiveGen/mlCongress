                                 A BILL


 
   To direct the Secretary of Transportation to study and report on 
  existing ferry operations and potential ferry routes in the United 
States, to authorize the Secretary to provide financial assistance for 
      the development of ferry operations, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Ferry Intermodal Transportation 
Act''.

SEC. 2. FERRIES.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:
            (1) Today's ferries are a critical transportation component 
        in many communities, providing vital transportation services 
        for passengers, automobiles, buses, and trucks in locations 
        where practical alternatives are insufficient or do not exist.
            (2) Ferries provide alternatives to other transport modes 
        that are facing severe capacity constraints.
            (3) Ferries do not require the construction of costly 
        infrastructure such as roads, bridges, or tunnels, thereby 
        reducing environmental impacts, capital investment, and the 
        time required to begin operation.
            (4) Ferries reduce single-occupancy vehicle traffic, 
        thereby reducing traffic congestion, air pollution, and energy 
        use.
            (5) Ferries are flexible because vessels and some loading 
        facilities may be shifted to new locations to respond to 
        changes in demand or in times of national emergency.
            (6) Joint efforts by private operators and local 
        governments already have resulted in highly innovative and 
        successful ferry operations in many urban areas.
            (7) The Department of Transportation strategic plan for the 
        National Transportation System urges emphasis on those modes of 
        transportation that promote those interests ``of critical 
        importance to our country, including clean air, reducing energy 
        consumption and safe, comfortable, and cost effective 
        transportation'' goals that ferry transportation embodies.
            (8) Ferry transportation is an important and unique 
        component of the national transportation system which should be 
        encouraged and supported in those communities for which it is 
        applicable.
    (b) Study.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretary of Transportation shall 
        conduct a study of ferry transportation in the United States 
        and its possessions--
                    (A) to identify existing ferry operations, 
                including--
                            (i) the locations and routes served;
                            (ii) the name, the United States official 
                        number, and a description of each vessel 
                        operated as a ferry;
                            (iii) the source and amount, if any, of 
                        funds derived from Federal, State, or local 
                        government sources supporting ferry operations; 
                        and
                            (iv) the impact of ferry transportation on 
                        local and regional economies; and
                    (B) to identify potential domestic ferry routes in 
                the United States and its possessions and to develop 
                information on those routes, including--
                            (i) locations and routes that might be 
                        served;
                            (ii) estimates of capacity required;
                            (iii) estimates of capital costs of 
                        developing those routes;
                            (iv) estimates of annual operating costs 
                        for these routes;
                            (v) estimates of the economic impact of 
                        these routes on local and regional economies; 
                        and
                            (vi) the potential for use of high speed 
                        ferry services.
            (2) Report.--The Secretary shall submit a report on the 
        results of the study required under subsection (a) to the

        officer of each metropolitan area in which a ferry service is 
        operated or for which a potential ferry route is identified in 
        the report; and
            (2) in that meeting discuss the results of the study under 
        subsection (a) and availability of resources, both Federal and 
        State, for providing ferry services.
