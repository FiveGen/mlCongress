        middle income Americans.

should enact legislation providing targeted tax relief, with an 
emphasis on alleviating the tax burden on middle income Americans, by 
enacting the following provisions:

SEC. 302. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON SMALL BUSINESS TAX RELIEF.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Small businesses are the source of most new jobs 
        created in this country.
            (2) Small businesses have a more difficult time than large 
        corporations in raising capital, covering health care costs for 
        employees, and coping with estate taxes.

should enact legislation providing tax incentives and tax relief for 
small businesses, including:
            (1) Incentives for long-term investments in small

SEC. 303. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON REVENUE NEUTRALITY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:

        explosion in the level of debt owed by American taxpayers.
            (2) Tax cuts without revenue offsets increase the level of 
        spending cuts required to balance the budget, in vital areas 
        like education, health care, transportation, and research and 
        development.
            (3) It is a priority to balance the budget first, and to 
        defer tax cuts which reduce revenues until the budget is 
        actually in balance.
            (4) Targeted tax cuts for higher education, child care, 
        homeownership, increased savings, and small businesses can be 
        enacted without reducing the net level of revenues.

cuts should be fully offset by revenue increases, through reinstatement 
of expiring excise taxes and the closing of corporate tax loopholes.

SEC. 304. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON CHILDREN'S HEALTH.

        projected increases in medicare premiums.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that Congress 
should enact legislation to extend the solvency of the Medicare Trust 
Fund for the next 10 years, using policies which:
            (1) Maintain part B premiums at 25 percent, with a phase-in 
        of home health care changes.
            (2) Provide new preventive and other health care benefits, 
        including expanded mammography coverage, coverage for

        seriously underreimbursed for the actual cost of providing 
        medicaid services.
            (2) Medicaid is the primary source of health care coverage 
        for the uninsured, including poor children, indigent mothers, 
        and low-income senior citizens in nursing homes.
            (3) Medicaid provides critical funding for medicare 
        premiums for low-income seniors.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that medicaid 
legislation should increase coverage for low-income adults and seniors, 
and uninsured children, by providing that:
            (1) Any reductions in medicaid reimbursements to health 
        care providers should be used to expand coverage for children's 
        health care, legal immigrants, and low-income Americans.
            (2) Spending reductions should not include either a block 
        grant or a per capita cap.
            (3) Medicaid should extend its program to pay medicare 
        premiums for low-income senior citizens, protecting them from 
        increases caused by home health care shifts.

        medicaid program, through managed care options, and elimination 
        of unnecessary regulations, while fully protecting the quality 
        and availability of health care for medicaid recipients.

and development, community development, crime, and housing.

        children with disabilities.

            (1) Adequate nutrition, quality health care, educational

in later childhood and adult development.
            (2) Public spending on health, nutrition, education, and 
        child care at the stage of early childhood development has 
        proven to be a sound long-term investment in human resources.

funding should be provided in the following programs to meet the needs
