                            JOINT RESOLUTION


 
   To direct the Secretary of the Interior to design and construct a 
    permanent addition to the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial in 
               Washington, D.C., and for other purposes.

Whereas President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, after contracting poliomyelitis, 
        required the use of a wheelchair for mobility and lived with this 
        condition while leading the United States through some of its most 
        difficult times; and
Whereas President Roosevelt's courage, leadership, and success should serve as 
        an example and inspiration for all Americans: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled,

construction of an addition of a permanent statue, bas-relief, or other 
similar structure to the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial in 
Washington, D.C. (referred to in this joint resolution as the 
``Memorial''), to provide recognition of the fact that President 
Roosevelt's leadership in the struggle by the United States for peace, 
well-being, and human dignity was provided while the President used a

    (b) Commission of Fine Arts.--The Secretary shall obtain the 
approval of the Commission of Fine Arts for the design plan created

according to the plan created under subsection (a).

        disability community, the Commission of Fine Arts, and the
