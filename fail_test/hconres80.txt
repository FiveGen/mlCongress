                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
Relating to maintaining the current standard behind the ``Made in USA'' 
  label, in order to protect consumers and jobs in the United States.

Whereas for the past several decades the ``Made in USA'' label has defined a 
        product as having all or virtually all of its parts and labor 
        originating in the United States;
Whereas the people of the United States depend upon the integrity of this label 
        when purchasing products;
Whereas the label projects a sense of pride for American workmanship and value;
Whereas the Federal Trade Commission has promulgated regulations to lower this 
        standard to allow substantial amounts of a product to be of foreign 
        origin;
Whereas lowering this standard will be a misrepresentation to consumers in the 
        United States who presently believe products bearing the ``Made in USA'' 
        label were all or virtually all made in the United States;
Whereas consumers in the United States are entitled to purchase products with 
        the understanding that the labels on these products reflect consistent 
        definitions; and
Whereas the Federal Trade Commission is responsible for safeguarding the 
        consumer from unfair, deceptive, and fraudulent practices: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That the Congress--
            (1) maintains that the standard for the ``Made in USA'' 
        label should continue to be that a product was all or virtually 
        all made in the United States; and
            (2) urges the Federal Trade Commission to refrain from 
        lowering this standard at the expense of consumers and jobs in 
        the United States.
                                 <all>
