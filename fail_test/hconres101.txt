                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
   Recommending the integration of Lithuania into the North Atlantic 
       Treaty Organization (NATO) at the earliest possible date.

Whereas Lithuania has reached a time of great political and economic progress;
Whereas Lithuania has held successful democratic elections since 1991;
Whereas Lithuania has made significant progress toward a more open economy;
Whereas Lithuania has dealt successfully with citizenship and human rights 
        issues by instituting one of the most liberal citizenship laws;
Whereas Lithuania has been on the forefront of several military initiatives, 
        including the Partnership for Peace program and the NATO-led 
        multinational military force in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina 
        (commonly referred to as ``IFOR''); and
Whereas Lithuania has applied for membership in the North Atlantic Treaty 
        Organization (NATO): Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That it is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) Lithuania should be commended for its progress toward 
        political and economic liberty and meeting the guidelines for 
        prospective North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) members 
        set out in chapter 5 of the study on NATO enlargement of 
        September 1995;
            (2) Lithuania would make an outstanding contribution toward 
        furthering the goals of NATO should it become a NATO member;
            (3) eventual extension of full NATO membership to Lithuania 
        would make a singular, lasting contribution toward stability, 
        freedom, and peace in the Baltic region;
            (4) upon complete satisfaction of the aforementioned 
        guidelines and all other criteria for NATO membership, 
        Lithuania should be invited to become a full NATO member at the 
        earliest possible date; and
            (5) Lithuania should be invited to attend the NATO summit 
        in Madrid on July 7 and 8, 1997.
                                 <all>
