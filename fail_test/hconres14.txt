                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
  To encourage the Secretary of State, foreign nations, and others to 
   work together to help reunite family members separated during the 
                               Holocaust.

Whereas thousands of Holocaust survivors may be living around the world, not 
        knowing that family members from whom they were separated during the 
        Holocaust are also still alive;
Whereas many Holocaust survivors are trying to locate living family members from 
        whom they were separated during the Holocaust;
Whereas many Holocaust survivors fled Poland to the United States, Israel, 
        Russia, and other Eastern European nations;
Whereas in July 1996, Russian resident Solomon Bromberg and his sister, Israeli 
        resident Rivka Bromberg Feingold, were reunited after a separation of 
        more than 60 years, both having believed that their entire family had 
        been murdered during the Holocaust;
Whereas the Bromberg siblings were reunited after a friend and a family member 
        contacted Israel's Jewish Agency, an organization which attempts to 
        reunite family members separated during the Holocaust;
Whereas efforts to locate the Brombergs' other sister and brother continue;
Whereas many Holocaust survivors may be living in the United States and foreign 
        nations, especially Israel, Russia, Poland, and other Eastern European 
        nations;
Whereas efforts, such as those long pursued by the Red Cross and Israel's Jewish 
        Agency, to reunite family members separated during the Holocaust should 
        be encouraged, especially in light of the dramatic reunion of the 
        Bromberg siblings; and
Whereas coordinated efforts of the United States, foreign nations, especially 
        Israel, Russia, Poland, and other Eastern European nations, and 
        organizations such as the Red Cross and Israel's Jewish Agency will help 
        to reunite family members separated during the Holocaust: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
that the Congress encourages the Secretary of State, foreign nations, 
especially Israel, Russia, Poland, and other Eastern European nations, 
and organizations such as the Red Cross and Israel's Jewish Agency, to 
coordinate efforts to help reunite family members separated during the 
Holocaust.
