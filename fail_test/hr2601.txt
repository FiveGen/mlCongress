 To exempt prescribed burning on national forestlands from regulation 
                        under the Clean Air Act.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. MORATORIUM ON REGULATION OF PRESCRIBED BURNING.

    Section 118 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7418) is amended by 
adding the following at the end thereof:
    ``(e) Prescribed Burning on National Forest Lands.--Notwithstanding 
subsection (a), for a period of 10 years after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall suspend the application 
of this Act to prescribed burning carried out by the Secretary of 
Agriculture on national forest system lands for the purpose of 
demonstrating that an aggressive prescribed burning program over time 
will lower the total amount of particulate produced from the combined 
outputs of prescribed fires and wildfires.''.
