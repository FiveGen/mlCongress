                                 A BILL


 
 To amend the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States relating 
to the definition of raw value for purposes of raw sugar import tariff 
                              rate quota.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. AMENDMENT TO HARMONIZED TARIFF SCHEDULE OF THE UNITED STATES 
              RELATING TO THE DEFINITION OF RAW VALUE FOR RAW SUGAR 
              IMPORT TARIFF RATE QUOTA.

    (a) In General.--Additional U.S. Note 5 to chapter 17 of the 
Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States is amended by striking 
paragraph (c) and inserting the following new paragraph:
        ``(c) For purposes of this note, the term `raw value' means the 
                equivalent of such articles in terms of ordinary 
                commercial raw sugar testing 96 degrees by the 
                polariscope as determined in accordance with 
                regulations or instructions issued by the Secretary of 
                the Treasury. Such regulations or instructions may, 
                among other things, provide: (i) for the entry of such 
                articles pending a final determination of polarity; and 
                (ii) that positive or negative adjustments for 
                differences in preliminary and final raw values be made 
                in the same or succeeding quota periods. The principal 
                grades and types of sugar shall be translated into 
                terms of raw value in the following manner:
                ``(A) For articles described in subheadings 1701.11.10 
                        and 1701.11.50, by multiplying the number of 
                        kilograms thereof by--
                        ``(i) for the full degree from 94 deg. to, but 
                                not including 95 deg., 0.9175;
                        ``(ii) for the full degree from 95 deg. to and 
                                including 96 deg., 0.945;
                        ``(iii) for the full degree from more than 
                                96 deg. to and including 97 deg., 
                                1.005;
                        ``(iv) for the full degree from more than 
                                97 deg. to and including 98 deg., 
                                1.0275; and
                        ``(v) for the full degree from more than 
                                98 deg. to, but not including 
                                99.5 deg., 1.0395.
                ``(B) For articles described in subheadings 1701.11.05, 
                        1701.11.20, 1701.12.05, 1701.12.10, 1701.12.50, 
                        1701.91.05, 1701.91.10, 1701.91.30, 1701.99.05, 
                        1701.99.10, 1701.99.50, 2106.90.42, 2106.90.44, 
                        and 2106.90.46, by multiplying the number of 
                        kilograms thereof by the greater of 0.93, or 
                        1.07 less 0.0175 for each degree of 
                        polarization under 100 degrees (and fractions 
                        of a degree in proportion).
                ``(C) For articles described in subheadings 1702.90.05, 
                        1702.90.10, and 1702.90.20, by multiplying the 
                        number of kilograms of the total sugars thereof 
                        (the sum of the sucrose and reducing sugars or 
                        invert sugars) by 1.07.
                ``(D) The Secretary of the Treasury shall establish 
                        methods for translating sugar into terms of raw 
                        value for any special grade or type of sugar, 
                        syrup, or molasses for which he/she determines 
                        that the raw value cannot be measured 
                        adequately under the above provisions.''.
    (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) shall 
take effect 15 days after the date of the enactment of this Act.
