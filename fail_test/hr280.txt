                                 A BILL


 
   To require the Federal Communications Commission to implement the 
recommendations of the Joint Board concerning universal service support 
                       for schools and libraries.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds that--
            (1) the Joint Board established by the Federal 
        Communications Commission pursuant to the Telecommunications 
        Act of 1996 has submitted its recommendations to the Commission 
        concerning universal service support for the provision of 
        advanced telecommunications services to schools and libraries 
        (CC Docket 96-45);
            (2) the interconnection of schools and libraries proposed 
        to be supported by those recommendations is essential to 
        preparing American students for the technological literacy they 
        will require to compete in the economy of the 21st century;
            (3) adequate financial support for the implementation of 
        that interconnection will be necessary to prevent schools and 
        libraries in poor and disadvantaged communities from being left 
        behind; and
            (4) therefore, those recommendations can and should be 
        promptly and completely implemented by the Federal 
        Communications Commission.

SEC. 2. COMMISSION TO IMPLEMENT REGULATIONS.

    Within 60 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Federal 
Communications Commission shall take all actions necessary to implement 
the recommendations of the Federal-State Board established pursuant to 
section 254 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 254) 
pertaining to the establishment of universal service support mechanisms 
for the provision of advanced telecommunications and information 
services to schools and libraries, as submitted to the Commission on 
November 7, 1996 (CC Docket 96-45).
                                 <all>
