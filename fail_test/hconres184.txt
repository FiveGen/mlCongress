                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
   Expressing the sense of Congress that the motion picture industry 
         should work to discourage tobacco use among our youth.

    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 

SECTION 1. YOUTH TOBACCO USE.

Whereas addiction to tobacco by our youth represents a serious threat to the 
        individuals using tobacco and to those who inhale second hand smoke as 
        well as the public at large due to the increased health care costs for 
        tobacco related illness;
Whereas efforts to combat tobacco use among our youth is a goal common to 
        antismoking and smokers rights groups alike;
Whereas the President, the Food and Drug Administration, and public and private 
        health officials across the Nation are pursuing an agenda of 
        discouraging youth access to tobacco, and preventing of smoking and 
        tobacco use; and
Whereas while Government officials and agencies, together with the private 
        sector, can provide leadership in efforts to stop youth access to and 
        use of tobacco, success in this endeavor will be greatly enhanced by 
        additional voices and actions from across America: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That it is the sense of the Congress that all individuals involved in 
the motion picture industry, including directors, actors, producers, 
and others, should recognize that the portrayal of tobacco use by 
actors projects cultural acceptance that negatively influences 
children, and that the industry should use its leadership role and 
voluntarily assist in discouraging youth tobacco use by eliminating the 
use of tobacco products in its productions, except for productions 
which portray the dangers of tobacco use.
                                 <all>
