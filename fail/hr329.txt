To require States that receive funds under the Elementary and Secondary 
  Education Act of 1965 to enact a law that requires the expulsion of 
           students who are convicted of a crime of violence.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. EXPULSION FOR STUDENT CONVICTED OF VIOLENT CRIME.

    (a) In General.--A State shall not be eligible to receive Federal 
funds under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 unless 
such State has in effect a law which, on the first day of each fiscal 
year succeeding the fiscal year beginning after September 30, 1996, 
requires a local educational agency to expel from school for a period 
of not less than 1 month a student who is convicted of a crime of 
violence.
    (b) Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be construed to 
prevent a State from allowing a local educational agency that has 
expelled a student from such a student's regular school setting from 
providing educational services to such student in an alternative 
setting.
    (c) Definitions.--For purposes of this section--
            (1) the term ``local educational agency'' has the same 
        meaning given such term in section 14101 of the Elementary and 
        Secondary Education Act of 1965; and
            (2) the term ``crime of violence'' has the same meaning 
        given such term in section 16 of title 18, United States Code.
                                 <all>
