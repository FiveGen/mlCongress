1998''.

SEC. 602. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Many of the Nation's urban centers are places with high 
        levels of poverty, high rates of welfare dependency, high crime 
        rates, poor schools, and joblessness.
            (2) Federal tax incentives and regulatory reforms can 
        encourage economic growth, job creation, and small business 
        formation in many urban centers.
            (3) Encouraging private sector investment in America's 
        economically distressed urban and rural areas is essential to 
        breaking the cycle of poverty and the related ills of crime, 
        drug abuse, illiteracy, welfare dependency, and unemployment.
    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this title is to increase job 
creation, small business expansion and formation, educational 
opportunities, and homeownership, and to foster moral renewal, in 
economically depressed areas by providing Federal tax incentives, 
regulatory reforms, school reform pilot projects, and homeownership 
incentives.

            (2) regulatory relief at the Federal, State, and local 
        levels; and
            (3) improved local services and an increase in the economic 
        stake of renewal community residents in their own community and 
        its development, particularly through the increased involvement

SEC. 702. RESERVATION OF SOCIAL SECURITY SURPLUSES SOLELY FOR SOCIAL 
              SECURITY SYSTEM.

    (a) In General.--Section 201 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 
401) is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:
    ``(n)(1) The Secretary of the Treasury, before the beginning of 
each fiscal year, shall estimate the amount of the Social Security 
surplus for such year. For purposes of this subsection, the term 
`Social Security surplus' means the excess of the receipts in the Trust 
Funds during the fiscal year (including interest on obligations held in 
such funds) over the outlays from such funds during such year.
    ``(2) If the Secretary of the Treasury determines that there is a 
Social Security surplus for any fiscal year, such Secretary shall 
transfer during such year from the general fund of the Treasury an 
amount equal to the amount of the surplus to the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York. Such transfer shall be made monthly on the basis of 
estimates by the Secretary of the Treasury of the portion of the 
surplus attributable to the month, and proper adjustments shall be made 
in amounts subsequently transferred to the extent prior estimates were 
in excess of or less than amounts required to be transferred. Amounts 
transferred under this paragraph shall substitute for (and be in lieu 
of) equivalent amounts otherwise required to be transferred to the 
Trust Funds.
    ``(3) The Federal Reserve Bank of New York shall hold the amounts 
transferred under paragraph (2), and all income from investment 
thereof, in trust for the benefit of the Trust Funds. Amounts so held 
shall be invested in marketable obligations of the United States with 
maturities that the Managing Trustee determines are consistent with the 
requirements of the Trust Funds. Amounts held in trust under this 
paragraph (and earnings thereon) shall be treated as part of the 
balance of the Trust Funds.
    ``(4) If, at any time, any obligation acquired under paragraph (2) 
has a market value less than its acquisition cost by reason of a change 
in interest rates, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York may, at any 
time, present such obligation to the Secretary of the Treasury for 
redemption, notwithstanding the maturity date or any other requirement 
relating to such obligation, and the Secretary of the Treasury shall 
redeem such obligation for an amount that is not less than such 
acquisition cost.
    ``(5) Upon request by the Managing Trustee, the Federal Reserve 
Bank of New York shall transfer to the appropriate Trust Fund the 
amount determined by the Managing Trustee to be necessary to meet the 
obligations of such Fund.
    ``(6) All transfers to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York under 
paragraph (2) shall be treated as Federal outlays for all budgetary 
purposes of the United States Government, except that such transfers 
shall not be subject to section 252 of the Balanced Budget and 
Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 and all transfers to the Trust 
Funds under paragraph (5) shall be treated as offsetting receipts.''.
    (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) shall 
apply to fiscal years beginning on or after October 1, 1998.
                                 <all>
