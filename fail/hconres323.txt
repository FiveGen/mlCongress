                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing the sense of the Congress that the Attorney General should 
            be an elected officer of the Federal Government.

Whereas the Attorney General of the United States is the chief law enforcement 
        officer of the Federal Government;
Whereas the Attorney General is nominated by the President and confirmed by the 
        Senate;
Whereas once confirmed by the Senate, the Attorney General serves at the will of 
        the President and is a member of the President's cabinet;
Whereas the Attorney General is often confronted with a conflict of interest 
        when an investigation of alleged misconduct by high-level officials of 
        the Federal Government is necessary;
Whereas Attorneys General in several recent administrations have been confronted 
        with possible conflicts of interest;
Whereas these conflicts seriously compromise the Attorney General's ability to 
        investigate alleged misconduct by high-level officials of the Federal 
        Government;
Whereas the public lacks confidence in the Attorney General's independence when 
        an investigation of alleged misconduct by high-level officials of the 
        Federal Government is necessary;
Whereas the creation of the independent counsel in 1978 did not solve the 
        problem of the Attorney General's lack of independence;
Whereas since the ``Iran-Contra'' investigation 22 independent counsels have 
        been appointed, and their investigations have cost taxpayers nearly 
        $130,000,000;
Whereas 43 States provide for the election of their attorneys general; and
Whereas the independent election of the Attorney General would protect the 
        Attorney General from conflicts of interest when investigations of 
        alleged misconduct by high-level officials of the Federal Government are 
        necessary: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That it is the sense of the Congress that--
            (1) the Attorney General should be an elected officer of 
        the Federal Government; and
            (2) the Congress should propose an amendment to the 
        Constitution providing for the independent election of the 
        Attorney General.
                                 <all>
