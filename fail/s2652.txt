        in which the unlawful act was committed, where the defendant 
        resides, or where the defendant has a regularly established 
        place of business. If the court finds that an unlawful act has 
        been committed, the court shall impose a penalty on the person

        the alleged unlawful act or was not warranted by existing law 
        or by a good faith argument for the extension, reversal, or 
        modification of an existing interpretation of law, the court

    Subsection (c) of section 4702 of the Omnibus Trade and 
Competitiveness Act of 1988 (21 U.S.C. 1401(c)) is amended to read as 
follows:
    ``(c) Volume Data.--The Food and Drug Administration shall use the 
computerized data management systems placed into effect under 
subsection (a)(1) to summarize the volume of each type of food product 
subject to the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act 
(21 U.S.C. 321 et seq.) that is imported into the United States in 
quantities that are determined by the Secretary of Health and Human 
Services to be commercial quantities. The summary shall be made by food 
product, country of origin, port of entry, pesticides for which the 
Secretary routinely monitors, pesticide residues detected, and the 
quantity of each pesticide exported from the United States to the 
country of origin for agricultural use. The summary shall also indicate 
the volume of each type of food actually tested for pesticide residues, 
arranged by pesticide, food, and country of origin. Information with 
respect to volumes of food products and exported pesticides to be 
included in this summary shall, to the extent feasible, be obtained 
from other Federal agencies.''.

                    TITLE III--PESTICIDE TOLERANCES

SEC. 301. REVOCATION OF TOLERANCES AND PRACTICAL TESTING METHODS.

    Section 408 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 
346a) is amended by adding at the end the following new subsections:
    ``(p)(1)(A) If the Administrator, acting under the Federal 
Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (7 U.S.C. 136 et seq.), 
with or without the consent of the registrant, either cancels the 
registration of each pesticide that contains a particular pesticide 
chemical and that is registered for use on a particular food, or 
requires that the registration of each such pesticide be modified to 
prohibit the use of the pesticide in connection with the production, 
storage, processing, or transportation of the food, the Administrator 
shall revoke any tolerance or exemption under this section or section 
409 that permits the presence of the pesticide chemical, or any 
pesticide chemical that results from its use, in or on the food. The 
Administrator shall, not later than 30 days after the date on which 
this subparagraph initially applies to the pesticide chemical, publish 
a notice in the Federal Register issuing an order revoking any 
tolerance or exemption for the use established under this section or 
section 409 for the pesticide chemical in or on the food.
    ``(B) The effective date of a revocation described in subparagraph 
(A) shall be 180 days after the date on which subparagraph (A) 
initially applies to the pesticide chemical.
    ``(C) The Administrator may delay the effective date of a 
modification or revocation of a tolerance or exemption from the 
requirement of a tolerance for a pesticide chemical residue in or on a 
food under this section or section 409 if the modification or 
revocation would require a lower level of the pesticide chemical 
residue in or on the food than the level in effect under the tolerance 
or exemption immediately before the date the modification or revocation 
would otherwise take effect.
    ``(D) The Administrator may delay the effective date, to permit the 
tolerance or exemption to remain at the level in effect immediately 
before the date the modification or revocation would otherwise take 
effect, for the period of time that the Administrator determines is 
necessary to allow foods that could contain the pesticide chemical 
residue as a result of lawful application of the pesticide chemical 
prior to the date the modification or revocation would otherwise take 
effect to be sold to consumers in the course of the usual practice for 
the production, processing, transportation, storage, and distribution 
of that type of food.
    ``(E) The Administrator shall designate the delayed effective date 
and describe the determinations supporting the selection of the date in 
the order modifying or revoking the tolerance or exemption.
    ``(F) Notwithstanding subparagraph (C) or (D), the Administrator 
shall, in the order modifying or revoking the tolerance or exemption, 
establish a shorter period of time for delay of the effective date, or 
provide for no delay of the effective date, for the modification or 
revocation, if the Administrator determines that the shorter period, or 
no delay of the effective date, is necessary to protect the public 
health during the period of the delay that would be required under 
subparagraph (C) or (D).
    ``(2)(A) If the Administrator, acting under the Federal 
Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (7 U.S.C. 136 et seq.), 
with or without the consent of the registrant, suspends the use of each 
registered pesticide that contains a particular pesticide chemical and 
that is labeled for use on a particular food, due in whole or in part 
to dietary risks to humans posed by residues of the pesticide chemical 
in or on the food, the Administrator shall suspend any tolerance or 
exemption under this section or section 409 that allows the presence of 
the pesticide chemical, or any pesticide chemical residue that results 
from its use, in or on the food.
    ``(B) The suspension of a tolerance or exemption under subparagraph 
(A) shall be effective as long as each associated registration of a 
pesticide is suspended under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and 
Rodenticide Act (7 U.S.C. 136 et seq.).
    ``(C) While a suspension of a tolerance or exemption is in effect 
the tolerance or exemption shall not be considered to be in effect. If 
the suspension of the associated registration of the pesticide under 
the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (7 U.S.C. 136 
et seq.) is terminated, leaving the registration of the pesticide for 
the use in effect under such Act, the Administrator shall rescind any 
associated suspension of a tolerance or exemption.
    ``(D) The effective date of a suspension described in subparagraph 
(A) shall be 120 days after the date on which the registration that is 
the subject of an order of suspension or an order of emergency 
suspension initially applies to the pesticide chemical.
    ``(E) The effective date of a suspension may be delayed in 
accordance with subparagraphs (C), (D), (E) and (F) of paragraph (1).
    ``(3)(A) In connection with action taken under paragraph (1)(A) or 
(2)(A) or taken with respect to pesticides whose registrations were 
canceled prior to the effective date of this section, if the 
Administrator determines that a residue of the canceled or suspended 
pesticide chemical will unavoidably persist in the environment and be 
present in or on a food, the Administrator may establish a tolerance 
for the pesticide chemical residue at a level that permits the 
unavoidable residue to remain in or on the food and will protect the 
public health. In establishing such a tolerance, the Administrator 
shall use the procedures set forth in subsection (e).
    ``(B) Not later than 1 year after the date on which action is taken 
under paragraph (1)(A) or (2)(A), and not less than annually thereafter 
until the date on which the revocation or suspension of the tolerance 
becomes effective, the Administrator shall reduce the tolerance for the 
pesticide chemical residue under this section or section 409, if any 
decrease in residual environmental contamination by the pesticide 
chemical, or residues of the pesticide chemical in or on lawfully 
treated food has occurred, based on information reasonably available to 
the Administrator.
    ``(4) Review of a final order under this paragraph shall be in 
accordance with subsection (i).
    ``(q)(1) The Administrator shall not establish a tolerance for a 
pesticide chemical residue, or allow such a tolerance to remain in 
effect, under this section or section 409 unless the Administrator 
determines, after consultation with the Secretary, that--
            ``(A) there is a method for detecting and measuring the 
        levels of such pesticide chemical residue in or on a food that 
        will detect the residue at the level established by the 
        tolerance; and
            ``(b) such method is the best available, practical method.
    ``(2) A method shall be considered practical for purposes of 
paragraph (1)(B) if--
            ``(A) the method can be performed by the Secretary on a 
        routine basis as part of surveillance and compliance sampling 
        of foods for pesticide chemical residues with the personnel, 
        equipment, and other resources available to the Secretary; and
            ``(B)(i) the method is a multi-residue method; or
            ``(ii) no multi-residue method is available.''.
