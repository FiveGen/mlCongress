                        consists of providing a benefit to the 
                        distributee which, if paid for by the

                        by reason of any other distribution shall not 
                        be so includible in an amount which bears the 
                        same ratio to the amount which would be so 
                        includible as the amount of the qualified 
                        higher education expenses of the distributee
