                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
Expressing the sense of the Congress that a national summit of sports, 
political, community, and media leaders should be promptly convened to 
     develop a multifaceted action plan to deter acts of violence, 
            especially domestic violence and sexual assault.

Whereas involvement in sports commonly places individuals in a unique context of 
        competition that provides an opportunity to teach, learn, and hone 
        qualities of responsible citizenship, including values that promote 
        self-respect and respect for others, and deter acts of violence, 
        especially domestic violence and sexual assault;
Whereas professional and amateur athletes and sports coaches are role models 
        with great national influence and have helped to positively shape the 
        lives of countless individuals;
Whereas professional and amateur athletes, and sports coaches, administrators, 
        volunteers, and team owners have participated in a variety of 
        outstanding and valuable community service projects throughout the 
        Nation;
Whereas many professional and amateur sports organizations have instituted 
        educational programs and other measures to deter and sanction 
        misconduct, including abuse of legal and illegal drugs, illegal 
        gambling, discriminatory practices, and other unethical behavior;
Whereas acts of domestic violence and sexual assault are serious, indefensible 
        crimes;
Whereas acts of domestic violence and sexual assault committed by athletes are 
        often not taken seriously and go unpunished, sending an insidious and 
        harmful message that this behavior is excusable and is not criminal;
Whereas most athletes do not commit acts of domestic violence or sexual assault 
        and these athletes, as role models, can have a profound impact in 
        deterring others from committing acts of domestic violence and sexual 
        assault;
Whereas there exists a Citizenship Through Sports Alliance that is made up of 
        the National Collegiate Athletic Association, the National Junior 
        College Athletic Association, the National Association of 
        Intercollegiate Athletics, the National Federation of State High School 
        Associations, the United States Olympic Committee, Major League 
        Baseball, the National Football League, the National Basketball 
        Association, and the National Hockey League; and
Whereas the Congress supports the existing activities of the Citizenship Through 
        Sports Alliance and its member organizations and encourages a broader 
        array of efforts to promote responsible citizenship by teaching 
        administrators, coaches, and athletes values that will help all who 
        participate in our Nation's sports culture to become better citizens: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That it is the sense of the Congress that--
            (1) a national summit should be promptly convened to 
        develop a multifaceted action plan to deter acts of violence, 
        especially domestic violence and sexual assault;
            (2) the members of the national summit referred to in 
        paragraph (1) should include--
                    (A) sports, community, political, and media 
                leaders;
                    (B) individuals with experience in youth advocacy;
                    (C) individuals with experience in antiviolence 
                advocacy;
                    (D) members of the Citizenship Through Sports 
                Alliance;
                    (E) Members of Congress; and
                    (F) other governmental and community leaders with 
                specific expertise in education and advocacy programs 
                that serve to deter acts of violence, especially 
                domestic violence and sexual assault;
            (3) the action plan referred to in paragraph (1) should--
                    (A) be designed to encourage the participation of 
                all administrators, coaches, and athletes, from those 
                involved in youth leagues to those who are involved in 
                professional sports;
                    (B) emphasize and promote values such as self-
                respect and respect for others, tolerance, non-
                discrimination, and gender equality as well as 
                teamwork, discipline, responsibility, and commitment;
                    (C) encourage and promote participation in sports 
                as a positive character building activity;
                    (D) promote a sports culture that encourages 
                integrity, honesty, fairness, inclusion, tolerance, 
                nonviolence, and a commitment to excellence; and
                    (E) include a high-profile public education program 
                and media campaign to deter acts of violence, 
                especially domestic violence and sexual assault; and
            (4) the members of the national summit referred to in 
        paragraph (1), and other sports, community, political and media 
        leaders should assume leadership roles deterring acts of 
        domestic violence and sexual assault and should support the 
        measures developed by the national summit referred to in 
        paragraph (1).
