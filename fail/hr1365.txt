 To amend section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to prevent

SECTION 1. APPLICATION OF SECTION 355 TO DISTRIBUTIONS FOLLOWED BY 
              ACQUISITIONS AND TO INTRAGROUP TRANSACTIONS.

    (a) Distributions Followed by Acquisitions.--Section 355 of the 
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to distribution of stock and 
securities of a controlled corporation) is amended by adding at the end 
the following new subsection:
    ``(e) Recognition of Gain Where Certain Distributions of Stock or 
Securities Are Followed by Acquisition.--
            ``(1) General rule.--If there is a distribution to which 
        this subsection applies, the following rules shall apply:
                    ``(A) Acquisition of controlled corporation.--If 
                there is an acquisition described in paragraph 
                (2)(A)(ii) with respect to any controlled corporation 
                (or any successor thereof), any stock or securities in 
                the controlled corporation shall not be treated as 
                qualified property for purposes of subsection (c)(2) of 
                this section or section 361(c)(2).
                    ``(B) Acquisition of distributing corporation.--If 
                there is an acquisition described in paragraph 
                (2)(A)(ii) with respect to the distributing corporation 
                (or any successor thereof), the controlled corporation 
                shall recognize gain in an amount equal to the amount 
                of net gain which would be recognized if all the assets 
                of the distributing corporation (immediately after the 
                distribution) were sold (at such time) for fair market 
                value. Any gain recognized under the preceding sentence 
                shall be treated as long-term capital gain and shall be 
                taken into account for the taxable year which includes 
                the day after the date of such distribution.
            ``(2) Distributions to which subsection applies.--
                    ``(A) In general.--This subsection shall apply to

                        or greater interest in the distributing 
                        corporation or any controlled corporation (or 
                        any successor of either).

                are not pursuant to a plan or series of related 
                transactions.

        distribution is--
                    (A) made pursuant to a written agreement which was 
                (subject to customary conditions) binding on such date 
                and at all times thereafter,

        This paragraph shall not apply to any written agreement, ruling 
        request, or public announcement or filing unless it identifies 
        the acquirer of the distributing corporation or any controlled 
        corporation, whichever is applicable.
