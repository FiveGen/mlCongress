                               RESOLUTION


 
         Relating to a question of the privileges of the House.

Whereas Loretta Sanchez was issued a certificate of election as the duly elected 
        Member of Congress from the 46th District of California and was seated 
        by the U.S. House of Representatives on January 7, 1997;
Whereas a Notice of Contest of Election was filed with the Clerk of the House by 
        Mr. Robert Dornan on December 26, 1996;
Whereas the Task Force on the Contested Election in the 46th District of 
        California met on February 26, 1997, in Washington, D.C., on April 19, 
        1997, in Orange County, California, and October 24, 1997, in Washington, 
        D.C.;
Whereas the allegations made by Mr. Robert Dornan have been largely found to be 
        without merit: Charges of improper voting from a business, rather than a 
        resident address; underage voting; double voting; and charges of 
        unusually large numbers of individuals voting from the same address;
Whereas it was found that voting from the same address included a Marines 
        barracks and the domicile of nuns, that business addresses were legal 
        residences for the individuals, including the zookeeper of the Santa Ana 
        Zoo, that duplicate voting was by different individuals and those 
        accused of underage voting were of age;
Whereas the Committee on House Oversight has issued unprecedented subpoenas to 
        the Immigration and Naturalization Service to compare their records with 
        Orange County voter registration records, the first time in any election 
        in the history of the United States that the Immigration and 
        Naturalization Service has been asked by Congress to verify the 
        citizenship of voters; and
Whereas the Immigration and Naturalization Service has complied with the 
        committee's request and, at the committee's request, has been doing a 
        manual check of its paper files and providing worksheets containing 
        supplemental information on that manual check to the Committee on House 
        Oversight for over five months;
Whereas some members of the House Oversight Committee are now seeking a 
        duplicate and dilatory review of materials already in the committee's 
        possession by the Secretary of State of California;
Whereas the Task Force on the Contested Election in the 46th District of 
        California and the committee have been reviewing these materials and has 
        all the information it needs regarding who voted in the 46th District 
        and all the information it needs to make judgments concerning those 
        votes;
Whereas the Committee on House Oversight has after over nine months of review 
        and investigation failed to present credible evidence to change the 
        outcome of the election of Congresswoman Sanchez and is pursuing never-
        ending and unsubstantiated areas of review;
Whereas contestant Robert Dornan has not shown or provided credible evidence 
        that the outcome of the election is other than Congresswoman Sanchez' 
        election to the Congress; and
Whereas the Committee on House Oversight should complete its review of this 
        matter and bring this contest to an end: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That unless the Committee on House Oversight has sooner 
reported a recommendation for its final disposition, the contest in the 
46th District of California is dismissed upon the expiration of October 
31, 1997.
                                 <all>
