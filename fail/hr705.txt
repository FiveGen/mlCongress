                        activity of all individuals for such year, 
                        other than individuals--
                                    ``(I) who are not owners of

                                taxpayer.
                    ``(B) Partners and s corporation shareholders.--
                Subject to paragraph (2), the determination of whether 
                a partner or S corporation shareholder shall be treated 
                as materially participating in any equine activity of 
                the partnership or S corporation shall be based upon 
                the combined participation of all of the partners or 
                shareholders in the activity.
                    ``(C) Equine activity.--For purposes of this 
                paragraph, the term `equine activity' means breeding, 
                racing, or showing horses.''

effect as if included in the amendments made by section 501 of the Tax
