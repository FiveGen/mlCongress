                               RESOLUTION


 
   Recognizing and congratulating Northeastern University on its one-
                         hundredth anniversary.

Whereas on October 16, 1997, Northeastern University will mark its centennial, 
        celebrating 100 years as a vital institution of higher education in the 
        city of Boston;
Whereas from its humble beginnings at the Boston YMCA, as its founder and first 
        director, Franklin Palmer Speare, remarked, ``We started with an eraser 
        and two sticks of chalk'', Northeastern University has evolved into a 
        nationally recognized university offering educational opportunities to a 
        diverse student body from the city, the commonwealth, and around the 
        world;
Whereas in 1912 President William Howard Taft laid the cornerstone for the 
        present-day campus, which was expanded in 1929 when the Boston Red Sox 
        departed for a ``new'' Fenway Park;
Whereas Northeastern University has distinguished itself as the preeminent 
        practice-oriented university, serving as the national model for 
        cooperative education, where classroom education and professional 
        experience are successfully combined;
Whereas Northeastern University is emerging as a prominent research university, 
        where the work of talented scholars in a variety of disciplines is 
        advancing knowledge and contributing to the betterment of society; and
Whereas at the core of Northeastern University is its mission as an urban 
        university with an unwavering commitment to the city of Boston, as 
        evidenced by its longstanding partnership with the Boston public 
        schools, its varied community service programs, and its efforts to 
        promote economic development and housing creation in its neighborhood: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That--
            (1) Northeastern University is an outstanding educational 
        institution that has contributed uniquely to the urban fabric 
        of Boston; and
            (2) the House of Representatives congratulates Northeastern 
        University on its one-hundredth anniversary and wishes the 
        university much success throughout its centennial year.
                                 <all>
