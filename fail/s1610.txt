      TITLE VI--ENSURING THE QUALITY OF FEDERAL CHILD CARE CENTERS

Sec. 601. Quality child care for Federal employees.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Each day an estimated 13,000,000 children spend some 
        part of their day in child care.
            (2) Fifty-four percent of mothers with children between the 
        ages of 0-3 are in the work force. Labor force participation 
        rises to 63 percent for mothers with children under the age of 
        6, and to 78 percent for mothers with children ages 6-17.
            (3) The availability of child care that is reliable, 
        convenient, and affordable helps parents to reach and maintain 
        self-sufficiency and is essential to making the transition from 
        welfare to work.
            (4) Only an estimated 1 out of 10 eligible families receive 
        assistance in paying for child care through the Child Care 
        Development Block Grant Act of 1990.
            (5) Full-day child care can cost $4,000 to $9,000 a year.
            (6) In many instances, high quality child care services 
        cost little more than mediocre services. An investment of only 
        an additional 10 percent has been found to have a significant 
        impact on quality.
            (7) Only 1 in 7 child care centers provides care that 
        promotes healthy development. Child care at 1 in 8 centers 
        actually threatens children's health and safety.
            (8) The education, training, and salary of a child care 
        provider make the difference between poor and good quality 
        child care.
                    (A) The average salary of a child care provider in 
                a center is only $12,058 a year, which is approximately 
                equal to the poverty level for a family of 3.
                    (B) Home-based providers earn $9,000 a year on 
                average.
            (9) Poor compensation and limited opportunities for 
        professional training and education contribute to high turnover 
        among child care providers, which disrupts the creation of 
        strong provider-child relationships that are critical to 
        children's healthy development.
            (10) Children placed in poor quality child care settings 
        have been found to have delayed language and reading skills, as 
        well as an increase in aggressive behavior toward other 
        children and adults.
            (11) Nearly 5,000,000 children are home alone after school 
        each week.
            (12) Although it is thought that juvenile crime occurs 
        mostly on evenings and weekends, juvenile crime actually peaks 
        between 3 and 6 p.m.
            (13) Eighth-graders left home alone after school report 
        greater use of cigarettes, alcohol, and marijuana than those in 
        adult-supervised settings.
            (14) The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 has provided 
        employees with a significant new tool in balancing the needs of 
        their families with the demands of work.
            (15) The number of single-parent households and two-parent 
        households in which the single parent or both parents work is 
        increasing significantly.
            (16) The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 has had a 
        minimal impact on business, and over 90 percent of private 
        employers covered by the Act experienced little or no cost and 
        a minimal or positive impact on productivity as a result of the 
        Act.
            (17) Only 57 percent of the private workforce is currently 
        protected by the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993.
            (18) 13,000,000 more private employees, or an additional 14 
        percent of the private workforce, would be protected by the 
        Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 if the Act was expanded to 
        cover private employers with 25 or more employees.

           TITLE I--IMPROVING THE AFFORDABILITY OF CHILD CARE

SEC. 101. INCREASED APPROPRIATIONS FOR CHILD CARE GRANTS.

    Section 418(a)(3) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 618(a)(3))
