    (a) Authority.--
            (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of 
        law, the President may delay, suspend, or terminate any 
        economic sanction (or portion thereof) with respect to a 
        foreign country, if the President determines and reports to 
        Congress that initiating or continuing such sanction (or 
        portion thereof), as the case may be, does not serve United 
        States important national interests.
            (2) Resumption of sanctions.--In the case of any sanction 
        delayed or suspended under paragraph (1), the President may 
        impose or resume imposition of the sanction, as the case may 
        be, if the President notifies the appropriate congressional 
        committees 30 days in advance.
    (b) Contents of Reports.--
            (1) In general.--A report submitted under subsection (a) 
        shall contain a description of the sanction (or portion 
        thereof) that the President proposes to delay, suspend, or 
        terminate and a detailed explanation of the events that have 
        occurred to make the imposition or continuation of the sanction 
        not in United States important national interests.
            (2) With respect to suspended sanctions.--In the case of 
        any sanction delayed or suspended under subsection (a), the 
        report required by that subsection shall include a statement of 
        the terms and conditions under which the sanction is delayed or 
        suspended.
    (c) Disapproval of Proposed Delays, Suspensions, or Terminations.--
            (1) Suspensions or terminations of sanctions.--In the case 
        of a suspension or termination of a sanction (or portion 
        thereof) described in a report submitted pursuant to subsection 
        (a), the suspension or termination shall take effect 30 days 
        after the President has submitted such report to Congress, 
        unless before that time, Congress has enacted a joint 
        resolution disapproving the determination made under subsection 
        (a).
            (2) Delays of sanctions.--In the case of a delay of a 
        sanction described in a report submitted pursuant to subsection 
        (a), the delay of a new sanction shall take effect immediately 
        following the submission of a report to Congress under 
        subsection (b)(1) of this section and shall remain in effect 
        until the President determines otherwise pursuant to subsection 
        (a)(2), unless Congress enacts a joint resolution disapproving 
        the determination under subsection (a) within 30 days of the 
        date the report was submitted to Congress.
    (d) Congressional Priority Procedures.--
            (1) In the senate.--Any joint resolution under this section 
        shall be considered in the Senate in accordance with the 
        provisions of section 601(b) of the International Security 
        Assistance and Arms Export Control Act of 1976.
            (2) In the house of representatives.--For the purpose of 
        expediting the consideration and enactment of joint resolutions 
        under this section, a motion to proceed to the consideration of 
        any such joint resolution after it has been reported by the 
        appropriate committee shall be treated as highly privileged in 
        the House of Representatives.
