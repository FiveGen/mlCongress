                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing the sense of the Congress that a postage stamp should be 
    issued to honor the 150th anniversary of the emigration of over 
1,000,000 people from Ireland to the United States to escape the Irish 
  Potato Famine, and to honor the contributions these immigrants and 
              their descendants made to the United States.

Whereas the United States Postal Service selects subjects for commemorative 
        postage stamps from among events and landmarks with significance to the 
        history of the United States;
Whereas 150 years ago, Ireland experienced what became known as the Irish Potato 
        Famine;
Whereas between 1846 and 1850, starvation and disease in Ireland killed an 
        estimated 1,500,000 people and forced more than 1,000,000 people to 
        emigrate from Ireland to the United States;
Whereas the tragedy of the Irish Potato Famine and the resulting influx of Irish 
        immigrants to the United States had a great impact on American history, 
        society, and culture;
Whereas Irish immigrants and their descendants have contributed significantly to 
        the growth and development of the United States;
Whereas Irish immigrants and their descendants found opportunity in the United 
        States and in return offered their labor, strove to educate themselves 
        and their children, and committed themselves to civic and charitable 
        activities;
Whereas Irish immigrants and their descendants have demonstrated their 
        patriotism by serving the United States with valor in each of the wars 
        in which the United States has participated since the American 
        Revolution; and
Whereas today, more than 38,000,000 Americans are of Irish descent: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That it is the sense of the Congress that--
            (1) a postage stamp should be issued to honor the 150th 
        anniversary of the emigration of more than 1,000,000 people 
        from Ireland to the United States to escape the Irish Potato 
        Famine, and to honor the contributions of these immigrants and 
        their descendants to the history, society, culture, and 
        security of the United States; and
            (2) the Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee of the United 
        States Postal Service should recommend to the Postmaster 
        General that such a postage stamp be issued.
                                 <all>
