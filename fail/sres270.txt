                               RESOLUTION


 
    To express the sense of the Senate concerning actions that the 
   President of the United States should take to resolve the dispute 
    between the Air Line Pilots Association and Northwest Airlines.

Whereas a strike by the Air Line Pilots Association, the union of the pilots of 
        Northwest Airlines, has led to a severe disruption in air service;
Whereas such a strike could result in the loss of employment by tens of 
        thousands of individuals in the United States;
Whereas such a strike affects approximately 11 percent of the domestic airline 
        traffic in the United States;
Whereas such a strike would cause more than 44,000 Northwest Airlines employees 
        to be idle;
Whereas such a strike could affect--

    (1) the livelihood of thousands of other workers employed in airline 
and airport supply industries; and

    (2) commerce relating to tourism, logistics, and business requiring 
travel;

Whereas such a strike could cause substantial adverse economic effects in 
        communities of the United States; and
Whereas because nearly 20 percent of the air traffic of Northwest Airlines is in 
        foreign air commerce (as that term is defined in section 40102 of title 
        49, United States Code), a strike could have an adverse effect with 
        respect to--
            (1) the expansion of the market of United States goods and services 
        in foreign countries; and
            (2) the trading partners of the United States: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) the President should work in conjunction with the 
        National Mediation Board to facilitate a resolution of the 
        labor dispute between the Air Line Pilots Association and 
        Northwest Airlines; and
            (2) the President should--
                    (A) immediately after the enactment of this 
                resolution, encourage the settlement of the issues that 
                are the subject of the labor dispute through the use of 
                the services of the National Mediation Board 
                established under section 4 of the Railway Labor Act 
                (45 U.S.C. 154) or an agreement by the parties to the 
                dispute to arbitrate the issues that are the subject of 
                the labor dispute through the National Mediation Board; 
                and
                    (B) if necessary, establish a board under section 
                10 of the Railway Labor Act (45 U.S.C. 160) to serve as 
                an emergency board to investigate the matter relating 
                to the labor dispute and to make a report to the 
                President in the manner prescribed in that section.
                                 <all>
