SECTION 1. CALIFORNIA REFORMULATED GAS RULES.

    Section 211(c)(4)(B) of the Clean Air Act is amended by adding the 
following at the end thereof: ``Whenever any such State that has 
received a waiver under section 209(b)(1) has promulgated reformulated 
gasoline rules for any covered area of such State (as defined in 
subsection (k)), such rules shall apply in such area in lieu of the 
requirements of subsection (k) if such State rules will achieve 
equivalent or greater emission reductions than would result from the 
application of the requirements of subsection (k) in the case of the 
aggregate mass of emissions of toxic air pollutants and in the case of 
the aggregate mass of emissions of ozone-forming compounds.''.
