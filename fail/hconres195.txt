                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
    Expressing the sense of Congress in support of National Days of 
 Dialogue associated with the national celebration of the birth of Dr. 
Martin Luther King, Jr. to improve understanding and cooperation across 
         race, ethnicity, culture, gender, religion and creed.

Whereas America is a pluralistic nation comprised of individuals of different 
        races, ethnicity, cultures, genders, religions, and creeds;
Whereas this diversity is a source of strength for America, but also a source 
        for forces that can pull the nation apart;
Whereas these forces play on uncertainty, prejudice, and ignorance to advance 
        their cause at the expense of the greater social good which can flow by 
        abiding to principles of tolerance, justice and equality;
Whereas silence perpetuates division, conscientious dialogue is a pre-requisite 
        to resolving differences and ending prejudice because it not only 
        increases understanding and cooperation, but also creates a context in 
        which individuals can develop respect, empathy and compassion for one 
        another;
Whereas such dialogue helps people to see others as unique individuals, not just 
        as someone who is a particular race, ethnicity, culture, gender, 
        religion, or creed;
Whereas such dialogue is an essential ingredient in our nation's ongoing effort 
        to improve relations between individuals because it emphasizes listening 
        and seeks to identify areas of agreement in order to bridge the divide 
        that too often separates Americans;
Whereas such dialogue builds on the message of non-violence espoused and 
        practiced by the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., who dedicated his 
        life to bridging differences between people and addressing deeply rooted 
        divisions;
Whereas the work of Dr. King created a basis of understanding and respect and 
        helped communities, and the nation as a whole, to act cooperatively and 
        courageously to restore tolerance, justice and equality between people;
Whereas the effectiveness of such dialogue has continually been demonstrated 
        across the country during times of crisis, including successful efforts 
        organized in Los Angeles following the polarizing effects of the Rodney 
        King verdict and O.J. Simpson trials;
Whereas the convening of National Days of Dialogue, particularly in association 
        with the celebration of the birth of Dr. King, will significantly 
        increase the number of American citizens who take personal 
        responsibility to improve understanding and cooperation by organizing 
        small group dialogues in which individuals of different race, ethnicity, 
        cultures, genders, religion and creed will both learn from each other 
        and identify ways to work together to solve common problems;
Whereas National Days of Dialogue will help create a profound and positive shift 
        in the nature of human relations in our country and lay the groundwork 
        for the ongoing cooperation that is needed to solve difficult problems; 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That the Congress supports and encourages the convening of National 
Days of Dialogue associated with the national celebration of the birth 
of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. to improve understanding and cooperation 
across race, ethnicity, culture, gender, religion and creed and to 
build a lasting framework for reconciliation between all people in 
America.
